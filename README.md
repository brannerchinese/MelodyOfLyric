## MelodyOfLyric

Tools for the analysis of MusicXML files of transcribed Taiwanese cantillation.

Not yet documented. There is a slide file in the `presentations` directory.

 1. Description of process of transcription.
 1. List of functions available.

### Tests still needed:

 1. For `untested_code.py`. Move this code do `process_poem.py`.
 1. For `utils.get_melody()` and `utils.get_intervals()`.
