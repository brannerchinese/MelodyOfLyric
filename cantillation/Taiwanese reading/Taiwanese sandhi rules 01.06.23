Taiwanese Sandhi Juncture in the Reading of Classical ProseDavid Prager BrannerUniversity of MarylandThis is a draft of a paper to be presented at the Fourth International Conference on Classical Chinese Grammarat the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, 15-17 August, 2001.Please do not cite.. IntroductiongggIn an ordinary sentence, the majority of the syllables have “changed” (sandhi) values, and only a few have their basic (non-sandhi) values . Basic tone values are marked — although not phonetically — and their appearance generally indicates some sort of syntactic boundary.. Notes on dataSources of dialect data, including transcription conventions, are explained in full in a section of the same name in the references at the end of this paper. Here I call attention only to a few essential points. First, the “accents” (dialects) used in the sections on spoken and Classical language are not the same. For spoken Taiwanese, I have followed informants from the countryside of northern Ilan county, a conservative Zh¡ngzh¢u ∫s¶{-type dialect now succumbing to heavy influence from the rest of Taiwan. The rural usage of my informants is somewhat more conservative that than of Ilan city, but below I refer to this dialect as “Ilan” without further explanation. The scholars whose reading and chanting of Classical Chinese I have studied generally use a Quánzh¢u ¨u¶{-type accent, even if their native accent is different. They are not always completely consistent in the ways they render that accent, but I have always tried to record faithfully what has come from their mouths.Second, all materials presented in this paper are the result of careful transcription and repeated collation. I am aware that the vagaries of rural Ilan on one hand and adopted literary Quánzh¢u on the other may be unfamiliar to many native speakers. However, I have made every effort to prepare the most descriptively accurate material possible. Any errors are of course my own responsibility. Third, I take it as axiomatic that data is best represented in ways that adhere closely to its original form, barring specific needs to the contrary. It should be evident on a practical level that this is a matter of parsimony. It is also a matter of basic linguistic philosophy; I hold that, in matters of linguistic usage, conceptual issues (“theory”) are subordinate to data and derive naturally from the handling of data, rather than the other way around. . Spoken languageNotes below refer to the spoken language. ggg I have not attempted to give a thorough description of spoken Taiwanese grammar, merely to categorize the basic relationships between sandhi juncture and syntax. All sentences and individual lexical items are numbered in italics. Sentences are first parsed grammatically, then translated literally and finally put into idiomatic English. . Stress and sandhi juncture. Final syllables in generalWith some exceptions, the last normally stressed syllable in a sentence exhibits its basic tone value..	li3		beh7		khi5	to3-ui6	[note ]	Pron	Aux		V		PW	you	want to	go		where?	“Where do you want to go?”.	in1		long3		tih7		lai6-te3	[note ]	Pron	Adv		V			Direc	they	[total]		[progr]	inside	“They’re all inside”These two sentences contain no unstressed syllables and only the final syllables have unchanaged tone values. But the issue of stress is important, because words and syllables can become tonally unstressed (pronounced in the neutral tone) in a number of situations. One case is sentence-final particles, which are regularly pronounced in the neutral tone and preceded by a syllable in its basic tone..	a	indicates completed verb aspect; .	bo/boo	indicates a simple question; .	le	indicates progressive verb aspect. [note ]Words and syllables can undergo loss of stress in a number of circumstances. The syllable immediately preceding a neutral-tone syllable usually has its basic value, but there are exceptions.. Special cases of “final” syllableA pronoun as object is usually unstressed, and the preceding syllable has its unchanged tone:.	pai5-hong3=li.	hoo6=goa.	m6-bat7=iThat is one of a number of examples in which pronouns behave differently from other nouns in the same environment. ggg.In certain time expressions the syllable representing the unit of time is unstressed, and again the preceding syllable has its unchanged tone.	lak8=goeh etc..	chit8-goeh8=zit.	au6=zit.	tso6=zit “the day before yesterday”.	zit8=si=a “daytime”.	sam1-put7-goo6=si=a ‘occasionally’. Extent complementsMost verb complements have normal stress, and tones ordinarily change before them. ggg much data lost here. However, certain verb complements (directional, extent) are unstressed and there is a juncture before them. Note that if the complement is emphatically given its proper tone, the preceding verb will then have a changed tone. .	khoaN5#=chit=pai	V#			Compl	look		once	“to look once” ~ “to have a look”Compare:.	khoaN5	chit8	pai3	V			Compl	look		once	“to look just once”tends only to be used with chit8 ggg.	khah7-toa6=chit=sut=a=e.	koh7 chiah8=chit=te ggg checkIf there is a particle between verb and complement then both verb and particle change tones normally. ggg what?Certain particles are normally unstressed. ggg cf. aboveX=tit. .	Han3=tit.	e6-ki5=tit.V # tioh0. If tioh8 is followed by an object of the verb, the verb itself does change tone. Examples: .	ka7 peng2-iu3 tu3=tioh vs. tu3=tioh peng2-iu3..	tng3=khi-theng5-hau6 (tng3 changes)“optional” examples, which in normal speech change tone but which can resist tone change to add emphasis.Ggg data.	bo2=khi=a.	khun5=khi=a. Delimitation of syntactic units within the sentence. Subject and topicSandhi juncture also serves to delimit certain syntactic units within the sentence. The most important of these is the subject, the last syllable of which is tonally marked. [examples].S # V. (note: interesting example: Sio3-seN5 # X. implies S-V structure rather than V-O structure.)An exception is that pronouns as S do change tone. [examples].Topic-Comment functions similarly: .	chit7	phoe1		hoe5#		pun3 chiN2#	ke6	Topic 1#.......................	Comment 1..........................									Topic 2 #			Comment 2	Pron	Meas		N			N					Adj	 this 	 [meas] 	 wares 	 basic cost 		 low 	“These products cost the company little.”.	goa3	sek8-sai6	i1#		chin1 ku3	=a	Topic#.......................	Comment...................	Pron	V			O		Adj			Particle	 I 		 know 	 him 	 a long time	[change] 	“I have known him a long time now.”.	teng3-kang3# u6 mia2-siaN1, e6-kang3# u6 chhut7-miaN.	i1 cho5 khang1-khoe5# kha1-chhiu3# chiok kin3=e.	bok8-cheng2# kok7-lai6# chhi6-tiuN2# siau-loo6# siaN3-khoan3.	chit8-tiuN-phoe1# kia5-khi5-bi3-kok7# goa6-che6pivot-nouns (often w/u6): .	u6-ki1-hoe6 # V (pivot?); .	u6 phai5 ki1-su1# chu6-chhiuN3# cho5-chi3-to7-oan5.	u6 kian5-pun3# bian3-hui5# toa6 cheng6-sang5The pivot noun behaves simultaneously as object and subject, and displays the sandhi juncture typical of a subject. As with regular subject-pronouns, pivot pronouns do undergo tone change.: .	chhoa6 goa3 kiaN2=chit=pai.	kau5-goa3 hioh7-khun5. Coordinate expressionsThere is normally a sandhi juncture between coordinate items and before any connective particles.Between coordinate phrases (thoan2-tsong1# chiap7-tai6).Before temporal connectives between phrases (to6, chiu6, chiah7, chiah7-koh7)Between lists of nouns, numeralsbetween pairs of numerals (phone numbers, etc.). Some people break numbers into groups of three. 7 digits: 3+2+2, 2+2+3 (much rarer). 8 digits: 2+2+2+2, 2+3+3.Between coordinate verbs/adjectives, also before the connective koh7. .	Cheng3-che2 # koh7 u6 oe6-seng1..	siu6-phai5# khi5 pai5-hong3 i1.	lai2-khi5 goan3-tau1# thit7-tho2.	khi5 kong1-si1# siong6-pan1.	lu3 kui5# lu3 ho3 (but cf. lu3-lai2-lu3-, which has become grammaticalized). SubordinationSubordination in its various forms, principally modification of nouns and verbs, involves tonal marking in some but not all cases. The regular form of modification is that the modifier precedes the modified.. AdverbsAdverbs of time and place are tonally marked. “Adverb of place” includes examples where a place-word (PW) ends in directional suffix (lai6, teng3, kha1, etc.)..	siaN3-mih7 si2-kan# beh7-khi5ggg more examplesSimilarly, there is a sandhi boundary at the end of the duration-phrase in a sentence of the form “have not V-ed in [length of time].” Form: [duration]# bo2-V. Examples: .	chit8-ni2# bo2-lai2.	chin1-ku3# bo2-V.	saN1-ni2-lai6# e6 koh7-khi3=chit=paiCoverb phrases (consisting of a coverb and its object) function adverbially and are tonally marked, except when a pronoun is the object, in which case it is unmarked. .	goa3	kah7 peng2-iu3#	tih7		kong3-oe6 [note ]	Pron	Cov-O#				Part		VO	I		with friends			[progr]	talking	“I’m talking to my friends.”.	i1		ka6 tai6-chi5# 	kong3		hoa6 thiaN1	[note ]	Pron	Cov-O#			V			Compl	S/he	re. the matter	speaks	for me to hear	“S/he tells me about the matter.”.	ka6 goan2-liau6# 	khng5#=jip=khi	[note ]	Cov-O#				V#-Compl	re. materials			put inside	“[Someone] puts the materials inside.”.	iong6 ki1-khi5# 	chiat7-seng3 jin2-lek8	Cov-O#				V				O	by machine			save			labor	“to save labor by means of machinery”.	ti6 chhi6-tiuN2# 	siau1-loo6#	chin1	ho3	Cov-O#				S#				Adj	on the market		saleability	good	“It sells well on the market.”.	hak8-hau6# 	li6 goan3-tau1#				bo2	hiah7	huiN6	S#				Cov-O#						NEG	Adv	Adj	school		distant from “our” home	not		so		far	“School is not so far from my house.”Most adverbs other than time and place, that is those describing manner, do not have a sandhi boundary. Tone change ordinarily occurs at the end of them: .	hiam3+a	‘almost, very nearly’.	tu3-tu3	‘just now’ (also tu3-tu3+a) ggg why not TW?.	poo6-poo6	‘continually, over and over’.	uiN1+a	‘really, truly’ (ggg< u6+iaN3).	kan3+a	‘apparently’.	kan1-na1	‘only’.	tiaN6	‘often’ (also tiaN6[-tiaN6).	chiap8	‘hurriedly’.	sui2	‘immediately’.	liam2-piN1	‘in just a moment’ [note ].	an3-choaN3	‘how?’.	eng3-koe5+a	‘long ago’ (ggg note grammaticalization).	put7-chi3+a	‘rather, quite’In other words, there are two classes of adverbs: adverbs in general are unmarked, but adverbs of time and place, as well as adverbial phrases consisting of a coverb and object, are marked. I feel that for Taiwanese adverbial expressions, the marked state is similar to the shì…de ¨O…™∫ pattern in Mandarin: it emphasizes the conditions under which the action of the verb takes place. ggg what about s£…ê pattern in TW?The speaker can emphasize an adverb by placing a juncture boundary after it. My impression is that this effect is more common with words of learned origin, which are often but not always calques of Mandarin forms. I have collected examples with the following forms.	chin1-chiaN5	‘really’.	choat8-tui5	‘absolutely’.	khak7-sit8	‘indeed, in fact’.	i3-keng1	‘already’.	ki2-sit8	‘actually, in truth’.	sui2-jian2	‘although’.	lim2-si2	‘on short notice, suddenly’In addition, there are some adverbs that my informants say never undergo tone-change:.	tai6-khai3 #	‘probably, approximately’.	long3-chong3 #	‘all in all, in total’.	m6-koh7(ggg?)	‘however’.	bo2	‘well in that case…’ (also na6-bo2) [note ].	an3-ne1	‘in that/this way, in that case…’ ggg no change?.	bian3-hui5# 	‘at no cost’.	su6-sit8-siong6#	‘in truth’.	bok8-cheng2#	‘at present’.	kok7-lai6# 	‘domestically, within Taiwan’I can suggest two reasons for their lack of tone change. First, most of these examples introduce the speaker’s opinion or a summation of the situation. The one example that does not express opinion or summation, bian3-hui5#, is in my view behaving not as an adverb but as a verb phrase in its own right: “[you] do not need to pay”, so that when before another verb it creates a coordinate relationship between the two verb phrases:gggSecond, most of the adverbs that never change tone are very saliently of learned origin. Marking them by means of a sandhi juncture makes them sound more formal, and thus reinforces their learned quality. It happens that adverbs appearing within 4-character idioms generally end in a sandhi juncture: .	to1-to1# chi3-kau5 	ADV	V	much	provide instruction	“I humbly request your guidance.” (polite).	ggg more examples ggg (Three of these examples — su6-sit8-siong6#, bok8-cheng2#, kok7-lai6# — also contain a directional suffix, making them susceptible to juncture for formal reasons alone.) ggg note grammaticalization of one with +a: tai6-khai3+a. Noun-modifiers and possessionModifiers of a noun (including possession) are marked by an unchanged tone in their final syllable.Possession and modification are most often expressed using the particle e2..	lau6-su1# e2-chhu5.	chit8-khoo1# e2-gin2-kak7+aLong modifiers sometimes appear without e2 but are nevertheless marked tonally: .	choan2-chu6-tong6-hua5# ki1-khi5.	li3 chit7-ma3 teh7 khoaN5# chit7 kui3 khoan3 san3-phin3Discrete semantic units within a compound phrase are also sometimes marked tonally, especially proper nouns within a compound noun phrase. Examples: .	uan3-tong1# pah7-hoe5-kong1-si1 (Yeuandong Baehuohgongsy); .	Jit8-pun3# hong1-bin6Some number-expressions containing more than one measure word have the larger units marked:.	Chit8-tiam3 # saN1-chap8-hun1 but Chit8-tiam3-poaN5.	saN1-ban6# saN1-chheng1# saN1-pah7 saN1-chap8-saN1Nouns preceding directional suffixes are considered to modify them and are therefore marked:.	chhut7-kok# chin5-cheng.	tu2-liau3 thau2 chit8 khoan3# i3-goa6....	lin3-chhu5# goa6-khau3.
