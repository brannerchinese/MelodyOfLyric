Classical Poetry in Taiwanese David Prager Branner< dpb23@columbia.edu >University of Maryland1. Introduction“Taiwanese” in this paper refers to the Southern M•n dialects as spoken in Taiwan. Although there are some popular objections to the use of this term, it is widely understood and translates the Mandarin terms Táiyº •xªy and Táiw¡nhuà •x∆W∏‹, which have the same meaning and are similarly objected to by some people. I therefore use “Taiwanese” in this paper in its linguistic sense with apologies but without further explanation. “Taiwanese” is also an ethnic term. It is not easily defined — indeed, there is fervid disagreement about what it means — but I shall use it here to mean “the ethnicity encompassing those people who are fluent speakers of Taiwanese or who identify with the culture of fluent speakers of Taiwanese”.“Chanting” in Chinese culture is something poorly understood in the West. It is not outright singing, but rather the use of the tones of a given Chinese dialect to create a semi-musical performance of a work of literature, usually but not exclusively poetry. The pitches and contours of the tones are exaggerated, so that the music inherent in the language itself is projected onto a musical scale (usually but not always the pentatonic scale). The effect depends on the practitioner’s skill, but it may be described as a kind of melodic declamation. By “chanting” I render the Mandarin word yínsòng ßuªw. Yín ßu and sòng ªw are two ancient separate words for this practice, distinguished in one recent study on the subject as y£nyùehuà ≠µº÷§∆ “musicalization of poetry” as against y• sh™ng jié zh£ •H¡n∏`§ß “constraining it by sound”, especially rhythm (Lin Wen-pao 1989:59-61). Because Chinese literati chanting tends not to be fixed as a musical composition it would be inapt to compare it with the recitative of European opera, although conceptually that may be the closest familiar example. Yuen Ren Chao wrote that the difference between chanting and singing was not one of kind but of usage (1930:1). There is at present a growing chanting movement in Taiwan. It is nothing so trendy as the great gastronomic and commercial fads that periodically sweep through Taiwan society, but plainly something has happened in the past few years. Whereas until recently most traditional chanting was to be heard only in small poetry societies, there are now a number of publications on the subject as well as recordings, and poetry societies themselves are experiencing a resurgence of interest.My title uses “classical literature” in the loose sense. It is meant to include anything up to Sòng literature, and even later. The nature of the language used is not ordinary spoken Taiwanese, but character readings as well as other effects (this is discussed in Branner ms. 2). For example: the character ¶— “old” is pronounced lau d» (spoken), as opposed to nØ` 3» (character reading). The two pronunciations differ in initial (l vs. n), final (au vs. Ø`), and tone. The character reading nØ` 3» is never used in speech except when reading something formal (which is rarely done), or quoting a learnèd saying. In rough terms, lau d» is a real word, while nØ` 3» is a rarely used form comparable to a Latin or Greek technical word in English. In reading and chanting classical literature, only the rare character readings are supposed to be used. It is often alleged that this reading pronunciation is a survival of the language of the Táng dynasty, although close examination shows that to be far from the truth. It is actually a late local form of one of the traditional southern reading accents, which varied from place to place but which had certain features in common. That traditional pronunciation surely derives in some way from Táng reading traditions, but in truth it is probably not much like the real thing. As with the Cantonese equivalent, the Taiwanese reading accent is employed in the reading of high literature of all pre-modern periods, not only Táng literature. Indeed, its legitimacy is precisely that the “Táng voice”, whatever that has meant at different places and times, has been used to read much pre-modern literature in all the time since the end of the Táng.Traditional-style poetry and its reading practice were closely connected with the k™jº ¨Ï¡| “official examination” system for much of that time. In China proper, the official examinations and their intellectual trappings underwent a series of wrenching transformations, not the least of which was the May Fourth Movement, which advocated the use of Mandarin to replace more formal written styles. In Taiwan, however, the k™jº tradition was simply cut off, overnight, by the 1895 Japanese occupation. In Nationalist and later Communist China, new ways of writing and reading Mandarin were actively promulgated by the Governments, and these movements were supported by a large proportion of the intelligentsia. During the first 40 years of Communist rule, much stigma was attached even to educated ways of speaking, and there remains a strong tendency to “working class” speech and writing, which intellectuals have gradually learned to resist. In Japanese-ruled Taiwan, by contrast, the tokens of traditional literate culture were treasured by many locals as symbols of ethnic Hàn identity (see Liao 1999:289-297). Because traditional Chinese learning was eclipsed in Taiwan rather than being undermined as in the Mainland, it survived for much longer intact, and with far less Mandarin influence. The history of Mandarin has yet to be written. The relationship between standard and non-standard languages is complex in any society, and in greater China, with its wrenching social upheavals and stunning linguistic diversity, the situation can hardly be summed up in any simple way. Although the vernacular language movement is said to have begun in 1919, its influence was mainly urban and limited to the Mainland. No doubt many parts of the mainland were like the small city of Lóngyán ¿s≈… in Fukien, where Mandarin was traditionally spoken only between the local prefect and his translator (tíhuà ¥£∏‹, [ti33 guâ34]) while the local population heard essentially nothing but only local dialects until the late 1930’s or ’40’s (p.c. Mr. Chén Yízhì ≥Ø§@≠P, 1993). Taiwan did not really begin to be exposed to Mandarin until the arrival of the Kuomintang in 1945; before that, educated Taiwanese who could not visit the Mainland had to study in secret from Japanese textbooks, as did the painter Lin Mei-shu ™L±ˆæ (p.c. Mr. Lin Ching-kuang ™L¥∫•˙ 1999). After the withdrawal of Japan, Taiwanese traditions of reading and chanting seem to have been largely ignored by the Mainland-dominated academic world. It is telling, for instance, that when in 1967 Wayne Schlepp recorded more than 300 oral performances of traditional literature with the assistance of the Chinese Department at National Taiwan Normal University, not a single one of his samples was in Taiwanese, and only one reader (Miss [Zh∞ Gu§ngpíng] ¶∂ºs•≠) even had a Taiwan ethnicity. “Taiwanese” and “Mainlander” were starkly different ethnicities in those days, and in many walks of life quite separate. Hence, the Taiwanese reading and chanting tradition continued to exist apart from the Mainland tradition.Today, Taiwanese linguistic culture has become a symbol of Taiwanese ethnic tradition and of Taiwan itself before the arrival of the KMT in 1945. It has survived in a number of places — most notably in small sh£shè ∏÷™¿ “poetry societies”, but also in koa-á-hì [g™z§ixì] ∫q•J¿∏ (Taiwanese opera) and in funeral liturgy as chanted by bonzes. Although traditional chanting still exists in Mainland China, recordings of it are not nearly as available in the marketplace as in Taiwan. The bibliography to this paper lists a few recent recordings of classical literature (Ji¡o Huàng 1999, S∞n Dàolín 2000, Wú Dé™n 1996), all of which consist of dramatic readings in ordinary Mandarin, without chanting. This paper considers some of the formal æsthetic features of traditional poetry that are exhibited through chanting: tonal prosody, various rhythmic effects, and xiéyùn ø√˝ or “accomodated rhyming”.2. Tonal prosodyThe hallmark of Chinese literati chanting is the expression of elements of internal “order” of poetry. That includes rhyme, tonal prosody, vocalic consonances and especially dissonances. Sh£ ∏÷ poetry is at the center of this movement, although other literature also appears. Generally the works one hears performed are well-known anthology pieces, although poets also perform their own work.What is the purpose of prosody in poetry? Characteristically, linguists and poets often see the matter in very different terms. It is informative to compare Matthew Chen’s 1980 article with the comments on it by James Liu and Wayne Schlepp in the same volume. As a descriptive linguist, my sympathies are with the poets in this round. John Hollander opens his 1988 book on poetic “scheme” as follows:That the matter of poetry is metaphor and not pattern will underlie the concerns and guide the explorations of this book. But that the energies of patterning are necessary to poetic representations is undeniable. […] These are the patterns made by curious and ordinarily irrelevant arrangements — of words, sublexical and suprasegmental linguistic sounds, syntactic schemes, and graphic elements, on the one hand, and twisting or turnings of sense and reference of words and utterances on the other. (Hollander 1988:1)3. accomodated rhyming:	Shyjing	Gwoshang	13-yuan	kok > kekIn chanting, yangpyng seems to be distinguished from inpyng in sandhi by slight tremolo. Not always heard, but also not rare.  it is not so much a sandhi form as a feature of a prolonged syllable - allows him not to have to do the whole long thingwith tone2.The píngzè distinction seems originally to have been introduced artificially into Chinese poetry (Mair and Mei ggg), but soon became a fundamental part of native prosody. Regulated poems are traditionally classified by their rime (rhyming category) and the prosodic value of the first prosodically crucial syllable of the first line (zèq• §∑∞_ or píngq• •≠∞_). There are four usual prosodic patterns for five- and seven-syllable regulated quatrain.If the quatrain rhymes in the píngsh™ng, the two patterns are:	píngq•:							zèq•:			°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥				°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥	five syllable line			°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥				°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥			°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥				°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥			°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥				°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥		°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥	seven syllable line	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥		°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥		°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥		°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥(In this paper, I use the following special symbols: °≥ represents a píng syllable; °¥ represents a zè syllable; °∞ represents a syllable that is not prosodically significant; || indicates a cæsura, which occurs after a prosodically significant foot.) If the quatrain rhymes in the zèsh™ng, the two patterns are:	píngq•:							zèq•:			°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥				°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥	five syllable line			°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥				°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥			°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥				°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥			°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥				°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥		°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥	seven syllable line	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥		°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°≥		°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°≥	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥	°¥		°∞	°¥||	°∞	°≥||	°∞	°¥	°¥The traditional practice in chanting is to prolong a píng syllable if it appears in any non-final prosodically significant position, and not to prolong a zè syllable in those positions. One of the effects of this practice is to highlight any píng syllable appearing before a cæsura and therefore the cæsura itself. Another effect is to create a contrast between the two lines in each regulated couplet. Below I illustrate this rule with transcriptions of some recorded performances. Note that the fact that this is not something unique to Taiwanese is evident in many of the performances in Schlepp’s collection (e.g.,#214, 227, 242, 252, simply to cite poems that will also be mentioned here).Consider first Dù Fº’s ß˘®j, classic poem “Ch∞nwàng ¨K±Ê”. The initial transcription is of a reading by Ms. Lin Hsiao-lin [Lín Xiàolín] ™LßµøZ (Hung 1999a:68).1	∞Í	Ø}	§s	™e	¶b	°∞	˚°¸	°∞	°≥	˙	kok \‹	phò b\	san \d	hò \x	tsai d\		Note 2	´∞	¨K	ØÛ	§Ï	≤`	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	¸	˛	se˜ \v	tshun w\	tshò \w	bØk \◊	tshim w\3	∑P	Æ…	™·	¬q	≤\	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	˚	˚	kam \w	si x\	hua \d	ts≠n \v	lui d\4	´Î	ßO	≥æ	≈Â	§ﬂ	°∞	¸°¸	°∞	°≥	˛	hun \v	p≠t Ï\	nia`u 3\	ke˜ \d	sim w\5	≤l	§ı	≥s	§T	§Î	°∞	˙°¸	°∞	°≥	¸	ho˜ \d	hØ` 3\	l≠n \v	sam \d	guat „\6	Æa	Æ—	©Ë	∏U	™˜	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	˚	˛	ka \d	su w\	ti \w	ban \v	kim w\7	•’	¿Y	∑k	ßÛ	µu	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	˚	˙	pek \◊	thò x\	sò \d	ke˜ \3	tuan 3\8	¥˝	±˝	§£	≥”	¬Ø	°∞	¸||	°∞	°≥	˛	hun \v	iok „\	put \‹	se˜ \v	tsim w\		Note In order to illustrate the relative durations of the syllables as chanted, I present below the actual waveforms produced by a chanted performance by Mr. Hung Tseh-nan [Hóng Zénán] ¨xøA´n (Hung 1999a:68).

I indicate the beginning of each syllable in the waveform using characters; I indicate the duration of each syllable using dots (“....”) after the character. It is evident that, as this poem is in five-syllable form, the second and fourth syllables of each line alternate in length within a given couplet.1∞Í........................Ø}......................§s............™e....................................................¶b.................................|2´∞..............¨K................................................ØÛ............§Ï........≤`..............................|3∑P..............Æ…..................................™·............................¬q..........≤\......................|4´Î........................ßO..........≥æ......................≈Â......................§ﬂ..................................|5≤l..............§ı................≥s..........§T................................§Î..........................|6Æa........Æ—..............................................©Ë....................∏U........™˜........................|7•’........¿Y..............................................∑k..........................ßÛ................µu..........................|8¥˝..............................±˝............§£............≥”....................¬Ø.........................................|Although a regulated sh£-poem may appear on paper to consist of eight metrically identical lines, in the mouth of a chanter every line has its own distinctive length and character. Performances from Schlepp’s collection, such as those of Ch‘eng Fa-jen [Chéng F¡rèn] µ{µo∞b of Húb¶i and Chen Ch‘ieh-fan [Chén Qièfán] ≥Ø¡Ê§Z of Ji¡ngs∞ express tonal prosody in the same way (Schlepp 2000[1967]: #242, 245). Clearly, as Yuen Ren Chao said, the principles of chanting regulated verse vary little from province to province (1930:1).Here is another example, Hè Zh£zh¡ng’s ∂P™æ≥π poem “Huíxi¡ng ªush∞ ¶^∂m∞∏Æ—”, transcribed as read by Lin Hsiao-lin (Hung 1999a:59).	§÷	§p	¬˜	Æa	¶—	§j	¶^	°¥	°¥°¸	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	°¥	˛	siau \3	siau 3\	li \v	ka w\	nØ` \w	tai \v	hai x\	∂m	≠µ	µL	ßÔ	∆K	§Ú	∞I	°≥	°≥°¸	°∞	°¥°¸	°∞	°≥	˛	hiong \d	im w\	bu \v	kai 3\	pin \3	mØ` x\	tshai w\	®‡	µ£	¨€	®£	§£	¨€	√—	°≥	°≥°¸	°∞	°¥°¸	°∞	°≥	¸	zi \d	tØ˜ x\	siØ˜ \d	k≠n b\	put \‹	siØ˜ \d	sek Ï\	Ø∫	∞›	´»	±q	¶Û	≥B	®”	°¥	°¥°¸	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	°¥	˛	siau \3	bun \v	khek \‹	tsiØ˜ x\	hò \d	tshu b\	lai x\The same recording contains two chanted performances of this piece, by Hung Tseh-nan and Mr. Cheng Lao-ch‘ang [Zhèng L§ocháng] æG¶—™¯ (Hung 1999a:59, 92-93). Although the performances differ considerably with respect to the relative lengths of individual words, they nevertheless have in common that they tend to lengthen the píng syllables and fail to lengthen the zè syllables before the cæsuræ:Hung	1§÷........§p............¬˜..Æa.....................................¶—.§j....¶^.............|Cheng	1§÷.....§p....¬˜....Æa............................................¶—.........§j..¶^...............................|Hung	2∂m....≠µ......................µL.ßÔ..............∆K§Ú............∞I.........|Cheng	2∂m...≠µ.....................µL...ßÔ....∆K...§Ú.....∞I.................|Hung	3®‡...µ£.......................¨€.......®£§£.¨€...............√—.......|Cheng	3®‡.....µ£..............¨€.......®£....§£....¨€............√—......|Hung	4Ø∫.....∞›.´»....±q..........................¶Û≥B..®”...................|Cheng	4Ø∫.....∞›..´»..±q.................................¶Û.......≥B.....®”.................|It is also noticeable that in all three chanted performances, the first line is longer than the others in the same performance. That is evidently also a convention of this style of chanting.A third example is L• Bái’s ßı•’ “[Jìng]yè s£ [¿R]©]´‰”, as read by Lin Hsiao-lin and chanted by Hung Tseh-nan (pub. Hung 1999a:63):	ß…	´e	©˙	§Î	•˙	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	°¥	˛	tsho˜ \d	tsi≠n x\	be˜ \d	guat \◊	ko˜ w\	∫√	¨O	¶a	§W	¡˜	°∞	°¥°¸	°∞	°¥	˛	gi \d	si d\	te \v	sio˜ \v	so˜ w\	¡|	¿Y	±Ê	©˙	§Î	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	°≥	¸	ku \w	tho x\	bo˜ \v	be˜ \d	guat „\	ßC	¿Y	´‰	¨G	∂m	°∞	°≥°¸	°∞	°¥	˛	te \d	tho x\	su \d	kØ \3	hio˜ w\And here are the relative syllable lengths. Notice that this is not a regulated quatrain, because line 2 has a zè tone in syllable 4 and line 3 has a píng tone in syllable 2. But the performer has nonetheless applied the usual rules of length according to the actual píngzè values of the syllables at the crucial positions:1ß…..........´e...................................................©˙.....§Î..........•˙........................|2∫√............¨O..........¶a.............§W...........¡˜..................|3¡|..¿Y..........................±Ê.......©˙...........§Î....................|4ßC.......¿Y..............................´‰................¨G..........∂m.......................|As I have described elsewhere (Branner ms. 3), the píngzè contrast is even emphasized in the chanting of Táng parallel prose. There is a very clear example in L• Bái’s ßı•’, “Ch∞nyè yàn zònqdì táohu¡ yuán xù ¨K©]Æb±qßÃÆÁ™·∂Èß«”, as read by Ms. Lin Hsiao-lin and chanted by Mr. Hung Tseh-nan and Ms. Lin Ya-p‘ing [Lín Y§píng] ™L®»ƒ´ (Hung 1999a:90-91 and 1999b:2/8). Transcription of Lin’s recording follows. Above I have already introduced the tilde ~ after a syllable as a symbol of gentle vibrato affecting some syllable in the yángpíng tone category. Here the tilde means that Lin draws out the syllable and applies melisma to its contour, an effect far more pronounced in the chanting and affecting more syllables than shown here.	§“	§—	¶a	™Ã	hu x\ ~	thi≠n \d	ti d\ ~	tsia \≈	∏U	™´	§ß	∞f	Æ»	§]	ban \v	but „\	tsi \d	gek \◊	li \3 ~	ia \≈	•˙	≥±	™Ã	ko˜ \d	im w\	tsia \≈	¶ 	•N	§ß	πL	´»	§]	pek \‹	tai d\	tsi \d	ko \3	khek Ï\	ia \≈	¶”	ØB	•Õ	≠Y	π⁄	zi x\ ~	hu \d	se˜ w\	ziok \◊	bo˜ d\	¨∞	≈w	¥X	¶Û	ui \d	huan w\	ki \w	ho x\ 	•j	§H	™√	¿Î	©]	πC	kØ \w	zin x\ ~	pe˜ \w	tsiok Ï\	ia \v	iu x\	®}	¶≥	•H	§]	lio˜ \d	iu \w	i 3\	ia \≈	™p	∂ß	¨K	•l	ß⁄	•H	E	¥∫	ho˜ b\ ~	io˜ \d	tshun w\	tiau \3	˜Ø` 3\	i \w	i≠n \d	ke˜ 3\	§j	∂Ù	∞≤	ß⁄	•H	§Â	≥π	tai \v	khuai b\	ka \w	˜Ø` 3\	i \w	bun \d	tsio˜ w\	∑|	ÆÁ	™·	§ß	™⁄	∂È	hue d\ ~	to \d	hua w\	tsi \d	ho˜ \d	guan x\	ß«	§—	≠€	§ß	º÷	®∆	si d\ ~	thi≠n \d	lun x\	tsi \d	lok \◊	su d\	∏s	©u	´T	®q	kun \d	kui b\	tsun \3	siu b\	¨“	¨∞	¥f	≥s	kai \d	ui x\ ~	hui \v	li≠n x\	ß^	§H	µ˙	∫q	˜Ø` \d	zin x\	e˜ \v	ko w\	øW	∫F	±d	º÷	tok \◊	tsam x\ ~	kho˜ \d	lok „\	´’	Ω‡	•º	§w	iu \d	sio˜ 3\	bi \v	i 3\	∞™	ΩÕ	¬‡	≤M	ko \d	tam x\	tsuan \w	tshe˜ w\	∂}	√£	∫·	•H	ß§	™·	khai w\ ~	khe˜ \d	i≠n x\	i \w	tso \v	hua w\	≠∏	¶–	¬“	¶”	æK	§Î	hui \d ~	u \w	sio˜ w\ ~	zi \d	tsui \3	guat „\	§£	¶≥	®Œ	µ˙	put \‹	iu \w	ka \d	e˜ d\	¶Û	¶˘	∂Æ	√h	ho \d	sin w\	˜a` \w	huai x\	¶p	∏÷	§£	¶®	li \d	si w\ ~	put \‹	se˜ x\	ª@	®Ã	™˜	®¶	∞s	º∆	huat \◊	i \d ~	kim \d	kok \‹	tsiu \w	sØ b\ggg3.

The best known compendium of xiéyùn materials is Zh∞ X£’s Sh£j£ng jízhù ∏÷∏g∂∞µ˘ (pref. 1178), in which the classical poems are made to rhyme in Zh∞ X£’s own literary reading accent. Some modern Chinese historical linguists look down on xiéyùn practice as bad science. It was, however, clearly an attempt to restore an æsthetic element to high poetry whose ancient rhyming had become inexplicable, and so should not be viewed in terms of early Chinese reconstruction.Examples of xiéyùn are found here and there before Zh∞ X£. The earliest surviving case is apparently a f§nqiè gloss by Sh¶n Chóng ®H≠´ (zì Z•hòu §l´p, 500-583) quoted in the J£ngdi§n shìwén (“Máo sh£ y£nyì §Ú∏÷≠µ∏q, §W/10b) on the character nán ´n in “Yànyàn øPøP”:®H§™®Û•y°B©y§D™L§œ°B§µø◊•j§H√˝Ωw°B§£∑–ßÔ¶r[Sh¶n says: a rhyming line; it should be pronounced {nem3}. Today we hold that people in antiquity used loose rhymes, and should not find it burdensome to alter characters.]The last line is celebrated as the title of a note by Gù Yánwº ≈U™¢™Z (1613-1682; 1966[1667]:1b), part of his attack on the exactitude of medieval phonology (although Gù himself calls it a famous line). Gù seems to have been the first person to view xiéyùn in moral terms; before that, and certainly for Zh∞ X£, it was evidently a practical, pedagogical matter. Gù elsewhere quotes a 725 decree by Táng Xuán z¢ng ≠•»©v proposing a xiéyùn reading involving the characters ª· and ´@ in the Shàngsh∞ ©|Æ—. The word written ø (not the modern simplified form of yè ∏≠ but a graphic variant of xié ®Û) is closely related to hé ¶X “to combine”; the principle is nothing more complicated than to read in such a way as to allow different sounds to combine in rhyme.Here is how Sh¶n Chóng’s gloss is to be applied. Below is the text of the third stanza of “Yànyàn”, with the rhyme-words indicated using their medieval values (following Branner 1999).		øPøP§_≠∏				§U§W®‰≠µ	em3			§ß§l§_¬k				ª∑∞e§_´n	nam1a			¬§±Ê•±§Œ				πÍ≥“ß⁄§ﬂ	sem3Since y£n ≠µ and x£n §ﬂ belong to the rhyme {-em3}, it is plain enough that ´n (nam1a) does not match them. Sh¶n Chóng’s proposal is to read ´n as {nem3} (Mandarin nín) to improve the rhyming. Xiéyùn is most closely associated with the reading of early Chinese poetry in medieval pronunciation. Below I present two examples.The first is the poem “Yuèch∞ §Î•X” from the “Chénf™ng ≥Ø≠∑” section of the Sh£j£ng ∏÷∏g. A performance chanted by Lin Ya-p‘ing is published in Hung 1999a:90. Lin prefaces the three stanzas of the poem with the opening of S∞ Shì’s ƒ¨∏˝ “Qián Chìbì fù ´e®™æ¿Ω·”, which mentions the first stanza. She reads the”Chìbì fù” passage, and then chants the Sh£j£ng poem.In her reading, the tones are somewhat different from most Taiwanese dialects: the sandhi value of tone 2 (y£nsh§ng ≥±§W) is a rising \q, rather than \w. I have heard this tone contour from older Changhua ∫s§∆ informants. Her tone 8 (yángrù ∂ß§J) in isolation appears to be Î\, rather than the higher value „\ more common among readers in Hung’s collection. Lin reads in a highly dramatic fashion, reminiscent of the báikªur •’§f®‡ of opera, causing most level tones (w\, d\, \d, \v) to drop at the end if at all prolonged. Transcription of the tones in the sung passage is much more tenuous than in the read passage, because the melody can conceal or distort the spoken contours. On the “refrain” syllables hê §º and h∞ Ω· she generally drops the initial h, and I have not transcribed it. As above, the tilde ~ indicates some form of melisma.Reading:1	§–	¶¶	§ß	¨Ó	zim x\	sut Ï\	tsi \d	tshiu w\ ~2	§C	§Î	¨J	±Ê	tshit \‹ 	guat Î\	ki \3 	bo˜ d\3	ƒ¨	§l	ªP	´»	sØ \d	tsu 3\	u \q	khek Ï\4	™x	¶‡	¥Â	©Û	huan \3	tsiu w\ ~	iu \d	u x\ ~5	®™	æ¿	§ß	§U	tshek \‹	phek Ï\	tsi \d	ha d\6	≤M	≠∑	Æ}	®”	tshe˜ \d	ho˜ w\	su \d	lai x\7	§Ù	™i	§£	ø≥	sui \q	phØ w\	put \‹	he˜ d\8	¡|	∞s	ƒ›	´»	ku \q	tsiu 3\	tsu \3	khek Ï\9	ªw	©˙	§Î	§ß	∏÷	sio˜ \v	be˜ \d	guat  Î\	tsi \d	si w\10	∫q	Ø∑	≤¿	§ß	≥π	kö \d	iau \v	thiau 3\	tsi \d	tsio˜ w\11	§Î	•X	°B	≥Ø	≠∑	guat  Î\	tshut Ï\		tin x\	ho˜ w\Chanting:12	§Î	•X	≤Æ	§º	guat „\	tshut Ï\	kiau 3\	e \ß13	À≥	§H	π±	§º	kau \w	lin x\ ~	liau 3\	e \ß14	µŒ	Ø∑	™»	§º	su w\	iau \w	kiau 3\	e \ß15	≥“	§ﬂ	Æ®	§º	°B	Ω·	§]	lØ \d	sim w\ ~	tshiau 3\	e \ß		u \v	ia \ß16	§Î	•X	µq	§º	guat „\	tshut Ï\	hiu 3\	e \ß17	À≥	§H	ÔÕ	§º	kau \w	lin x\ ~	liu 3\	e \ß18	µŒ	Ô 	®¸	§º	su w\	iu \d	siu d\	e \ß19	≥“	§ﬂ	›i	§º	°B	Ω·	§]	lØ \d	sim w\ ~	tshiu 3\	e \ß 		u \v	ia \ß20	§Î	•X	∑”	§º	guat „\	tshut Ï\	tsiau d\	e \ß21	À≥	§H	øR	§º	kau \w	lin x\ ~	liau d\	e \ß22	µŒ	§‘	≤–	§º	su w\	iau \3	siau d\	e \ß23	≥“	§ﬂ	∫G	§º	°B	Ω·	§]	lØ \d	sim w\ ~	tshiau b\	e \ß		hu \v	ia \ßTranslation1	In the Fall of the year Rénx∞,2		once the seventh moon was full,3	Master S∞ sailed out with guests4		on an outing 5		beneath Red Cliffs.6	A pure breeze blew gently,7		the waves were not stirred up;8		he raised his wine and toasted his guests,9	and chanted the ancient poem about the bright moon,10		reciting the verse that goes y§oti§o, “graceful…”Performer here recites the title of the poem11	From the “Airs of Chén”: “The Moon Appears”12		The moon appears, gleams, yea —13			lovely woman, fine, yea —14		moves away, graceful, yea —15			pains my heart, aches, yea —		(It is “display”.)16		The moon appears, splendid, yea —17			lovely woman, radiant, yea —18		moves away, allures, yea —19			pains my heart, burns, yea —		(It is “display”.)20		The moon appears, shines, yea —21			lovely woman, dazzling, yea —22		moves away, smoulders, yea —23			pains my heart, forlorn, yea —		(It is “display”.)Within the Sh£j£ng, this is quite an unusual piece. It has three-syllable rather than four-syllable lines, and the third line of each stanza does not break syntactically in the same place as the others. It is memorable for the large number of rhyming words it contains not only at the ends of lines, but within lines.  Although it is not regulated, Ms. Lin prolongs and ornaments the píng tones appearing before the cæsura (second syllable of lines 2 and 4). She correctly places the cæsura of each of the the third lines after the first syllable, not by pausing but by failing to make the tone change.Why does she say “Ω·§] [it is display]” at the end of each stanza? “Display” is one of the three types of imagery used in the Sh£, according to traditional criticism. Kªng Y•ngdá §’øoπF and Zh∞ X£ both consider this poem to be an example of xìng ø≥, indirect depiction, rather than fù Ω·. I have imagined these words to be the performer’s comment on the seductive woman in the poem. Lin’s voice, too, is dazzlingly seductive, and if this is the way S∞ Shì (in the story of the “Chìbì fù”) sang this poem, it is no wonder his guest was overwhelmed with emotion.In several places, Lin practices xiéyùn ø√˝ (“accomodated” or “harmonized” rhyming). It is most interesting that she does not slavishly follow the suggestions of the old books, but produces a set of readings designed for Taiwanese. In a word, this is modern xiéyùn.The rhyme-word of third line of the first stanza (™») should be read kiu 3\ in Taiwanese, but she reads it kiau 3\, following Zh∞ X£’s prescription for this poem. The reading kiau 3\ allows the whole stanza to rhyme together. In the second stanza, Ms. Lin uses xiéyùn readings for the rhyme-words hiu 3\ µq and tshiu 3\ ›i to create the same effect. These particular values, however, are not based on the two main sources for such alternate readings, the J£ngdi§n shìwén ∏g®Âƒ¿§Â (§Ú∏÷≠µ∏q, §§/2b; most of whose notes reappear in the commentary of Kªng Y•ngdá p. 378§U) or Zh∞ X£’s Sh£j£ng jízhù. Below is a table of the xiéyùn readings from these two sources, and Ms. Lin’s actual readings.rhyme-	J£ngdi§n shìwén’s	equivalent	Zh∞ X£’s	equivalent	Lin Ya-p‘ing’s word	sound gloss	reading	sound gloss	reading	actual reading	≤Æ	•j§F§œ	= kiau 3\	[none]		kiau 3\	π±	≠µ§F	= liau 3\	≠µ§F	= liau 3\	liau 3\	™»	®‰ªØ§œ§S®‰§p§œ°B	= kiau d\	≠µ¡B	= kiau 3\, d\	kiau 3\		§@≠µ®‰§F§œ°B	= kiau d\				ª°§Â≠µ§w§p§œ§S©~®ª§œ	= iau, kiu 3\			Æ®	§C§p§œ	= tshiau 3\	[none]		tshiau 3\	µq	≠J¶—§œ	= hau d\	≠µ©˛	= ho d\	hiu 3\	ÔÕ	§O§[§œ	= liu 3\	≠µ¨h°BøÆ‘¶—§œ	= liu, lau 3\	liu 3\	®¸	[none]		øÆ…¬K§œ	= siu d\	siu d\	›i	§C¶—§œ	= tshau 3\	≠µØÛ	= tshau 3\	tshiu 3\	∑”	[none]		[none]		tsiau d\	øR	§O•l§œ	= liau d\ 	≠µÆ∆	= liau d\	liau d\	≤–	[none]		≠µ™Ú	= siau d\	siau d\	∫G	§C∑P§œ	= tsham 3\	∑Ìß@È{°B§C§›§œ	= tsho, tshiau b\	tshiau b\For another example of xiéyùn in early poetry, I present the moving “Guósh¡ng ∞Íº‹”, from the “Jiº g™ §E∫q” in the Chºcí ∑°√„.

It is usually read in the third person, but may originally have been performed antiphonally, with two voices alternating between first and third person.)The composer has made several changes to the canonical text. In line 1, for “æﬁßd§‡ [wielding daggers of Wu]” he has written what sounds like tshau thã ko æﬁ•L§‡ [wielding foreign daggers]. In line 18, for “§lªÓæz [your upper and lower souls]”, he has written what sounds like hun kek phek ªÓ§Œæz [upper and lower souls].There are some other variants I cannot explain. In line 5, ∞} te˜ is expected to be read *tin. In line 7, Ìﬁ tek is expected to be read *tsip. These may be cases where my transcription is inaccurate, or the composer may have altered the text in ways that have escaped me. In line 8, the character œR is pronounced phu, which is in accordance with Zh∞ X£’s sound gloss “≠µß∑”.There are two interesting examples of xiéyùn in the rhymes. First, in lines 3-4, the rhyme-words hun ∂≥ and si≠n •˝ do not rhyme, but the composer has followed Zh∞ X£’s suggestion (“•˝ø≠µ∏ﬂ”) to read •˝ as if it were sun ∏ﬂ. In lines 7-10, however, something more complicated has taken place. It is clear that the last syllables of these four lines are intended to rhyme. The four words ∞®, π™, ßV, and , (this last is merely an ancient form of y¶ ≥•) belong to the yú ≥Ω rime group of early Chinese. Virtually all modern linguists now reconstruct this category as -a or something like it, and it is understood that both the medieval rimes {-a2/3} and {-uo1} derive from it. It happens that yú was one of the earliest rime groups to be discovered. Most of the early Chinese rime groups in their currently accepted forms were not known until after the time of Duàn Yùcái ¨q•…µÙ (1735-1815), who first saw how to study the the sounds of words for which no direct rhyming evidence existed. There are, however, enough examples of rhyming words in the yú ≥Ω group that even the earliest students of the field, such as Wú Yù ßdŸµ and Gù Yánwº, were able to see that words such as {maQ2} ∞® and {kuoQ1} π™ must originally have rhymed. However, it was characteristic of their methods that they were led to believe the sound of the yú ≥Ω rime group was some form of u rather than a as is now understood. It happens that Zh∞ X£’s xiéyùn glosses make the same assumption. For ∞®, he reads ø∫°∏…§œ (= {muoQ1}, Mandarin mº); for , he reads §WªP§œ (= {dzyuoQ3b}, Mandarin shù). The composer of the present setting has chosen to follow Zh∞ X£’s glosses, with the result that all four of these rhyme words are assigned uncanonical readings that are unfamiliar to the listener. So ∞® is sung here evidently as mu` (or perhaps bu) instead of its expected reading ma`; π™ is sung ku rather than the expected kØ; ßV is evidently sung nu` (or perhaps lu), instead of lØ; and , is sung su instead of ia. Hung Tseh-nan went to immense effort to reproduce Zh∞ X£’s accomodated rhyming, but perhaps it was not actually necessary. The usual pronunciations of these four rhyme-words are ma` ~ kØ ~ lØ ~ ia, and while they are not a perfect rhyme, they sound close enough to be viable.Xiéyùn is historically a medieval approach to reconciling earlier rhyming with living pronunciation. But at times we can observe xiéyùn-like practices being applied even to medieval poetry itself.

In traditional gu¡nyùn ©x√˝ “rhyming for the official examinations”, these words belonged to the notorious 13-yuán §∏ rime group — notorious because it combined many words that did not rhyme in any known variety of Chinese into a single entity. (See the discussion of this matter in Branner 1999:39-44.) Hung practices a kind of xiéyùn by “accomodating” the pronunciation of *guân ≠Ï to gûn in order to rhyme with hun ©¸. Not all practitioners do this in Taiwan today, and indeed there is some controversy over whether it is appropriate or not. Liang Chiung-hui [Liáng Jiªnghu£] ±Á¨≥Ω˜, for instance, reads ≠Ï as guân (1995:369; 1999c) because that is the traditional character reading.There are many such examples. In Wáng Wéi’s §˝∫˚ “Xi¡ngs£ ¨€´‰”, the rhyme words ™K and ´‰ rhyme correctly in medieval phonology, but have not in Taiwanese. Liang Chiung-hui (1995:327; 1999c) adheres to the traditional pronunciation, but Hung Tseh-nan (1999a:61) alters it in order 			medieval	Liang	Hung	¨ı®ß•Õ´n∞Í		¨K®”µo¥X™K	tsyi3b	tsi	ki	ƒ@ßg¶h™ˆ¬^		¶π™´≥Ã¨€´‰	si3d	su	siHung not only accomodates *su ´‰ to si to restore the æsthetics of the rhyme; he also changes ™K from tsi (which sounds like an obscene word in the Zh¡ngzh¢u accent of Taiwanese) to its colloquial reading ki. Although it is not a rhyme-word in this poem, Hung also reads *kok ∞Í as kek, because it is one of a number of common words whose rhyming pronunciation always needs to be accomodated. Here is an example from the opening of Bái J∞yì’s •’©~©ˆ “Chánghèn g™ ™¯´Î∫q”; the “standard” reading here follows Campbell 1913. 			medieval	dictionary	as prescribed 				(Campbell)	by Hung (p.c. 2001)	∫~¨”≠´¶‚´‰∂…∞Í	kwek1	kok	kek	±s¶t¶h¶~®D§£±o	tek1	tit	tek	∑®Æa¶≥§k™Ï™¯¶®				æi¶b≤`ª”§H•º√—	syek3	sek	sek	§—•ÕƒRΩË√¯¶€±Û				§@¥¬øÔ¶bßg§˝∞º	tsrek3	tshek	tsek	¶^≤∂§@Ø∫¶ ¥A•Õ				§ªÆcØª¬LµL√C¶‚	srek3	sek	sekHung also reads *tit ±o as tek, to maintain the rhyme.There are any number of parallel examples.

The principle that Hung and his colleagues follow is to preserve something of the æsthetic coherence of the original, even if that means altering the received reading tradition. In so doing, they are continuing the practice of xiéyùn, best known from the pedagogical commentaries of Zh∞ X£ but originating in the ly medieval period, when Chinese first began to realize that there was a painful gap between themselves language of their ancient texts.±i§Eƒ÷  ±Ê§Î√hª∑w\ 3\ b\ Ï\ x\ d\ „\\d \w \3 \‹ \d \v \◊~\ 	Æ¸	§W	•Õ	©˙	§Î		hai \w 	sio˜ d\ 	se˜ \d 	be˜ \d 	guat „\ 		§—	≤P	¶@	¶π	Æ…	thi≠n \dgai x\ —	kio˜ \v 	tshu \w 	si x\ 		±°	§H	´Ë	ªª	©]	tse˜\d  	zin x\ —	uan \3 	iau \d 	ia d\ 		≥∫	§i	∞_	¨€	´‰	ke˜  	sek  	khi  	sio˜  	su  		∑¿	¿Î	º¶	•˙	∫°	bi≠t tsiok  	lin  	ko˜  	buan  		©‹	¶Á	ƒ±	≈S	¥˛	phi  	i  	kak  	lØ  	tsu  		§£	≥Ù	¨’	§‚	√ÿ	put  	kham  	e˜  	siu  	tse˜  		¡Ÿ	πÏ	π⁄	®Œ	¥¡	huan  	tshim  	bo˜  	ka  	ki  				ReferencesBoyce, Conal1980	“Min sandhi in verse recitation.” Journal of Chinese Linguistics 8/1:1-14.Branner, David Prager1999	“A neutral transcription system for teaching medieval Chinese.” T‘ang Studies 17:1-170.Ms. 1	“Early Chinese morphology and its intellectual history”.Ms. 2	“ ‘Red Cliffs’ in Taiwanese Hànbûn”.
