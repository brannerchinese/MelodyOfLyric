Taiwanese Sandhi Juncture in the Reading of Classical ProseNotes below refer to the spoken language.In an ordinary sentence, the majority of the syllables have "changed" (sandhi) values, and only a few have their basic (non-sandhi) values . Basic tone values are marked - although not phonetically - and their appearance generally indicates some sort of syntactic boundary.A. Stress and sandhi junctureWith some exceptions, the last normally stressed syllable in a sentence exhibits its basic tone value.li3 beh7 khi5 to3-ui6in1  long3 ti5 lai6-te3  (note tua5, tiam5)The issue of stress is important, because words and syllables can become tonally unstressed (pronounced in the neutral tone) in a number of situations. One case  is sentence-final particles, which are regularly pronounced in the neutral tone and preceded by a syllable in its basic tone.a (indicates completed verb aspect); bo/boo (indicates simple question); le (<*teh; indicates progressive verb aspect).Words and syllables can undergo loss of stress in a number of circumstances. The syllable immediately preceding a neutral-tone syllable usually has its basic value, but there are exceptions.A pronoun as object is usually unstressed, and the preceding syllable has its unchanged tone:pai5-hong3=lihoo6=goam6-bat7=iIn certain time expressions the syllable representing the unit of time is unstressed, and again the preceding syllable has its unchanged tonelak8=goeh etc.chit8-goeh8=zitau6=zittso6=zit "the day before yesterday"zit8=si=a "daytime"sam1-put7-goo6=si=a 'occasionally'extent here. > stressggg much data lost here. khoaN5=chit=paikhoaN5-chit8-pai3khah7-toa6=chit=sut=a=eTones ordinarily change before verb complements. If there is a particle between verb and complement then both verb and particle change tones normally. Ggg databo2=khi=akhun5=khi=aoptional examples, which in normal speech change tone but which can resist tone change to add emphasis.before certain verb complements (directional, extent), which are unstressed. Note that if the complement is given its proper tone, the preceding verb will then have a changed tone and the complement will be  emphasized..X=tit. Han3=tite6-ki5=tit.V # tioh0. If tioh8 is followed by an object of the verb, the verb itself does change tone. Examples: ka7 peng2-iu3 tu3=tioh vs. tu3=tioh peng2-iu3.tng3=khi-theng5-hau6 (tng3 changes)Sandhi juncture also serves to delimit certain syntactic units within the sentence. The most important of these is the subject, the last syllable of which is tonally marked. [examples].S # V. (note: interesting example: Sio3-seN5 # X. implies S-V structure rather than V-O structure.)An exception is that pronouns as S do change tone. [examples].Topic-Comment functions similarly: 	chit7-phoe1-hoe5# pun3-chiN2 ke6goa3 sek8-sai6 i1# chin1-ku3 =ateng3-kang3# u6 mia2-siaN1, e6-kang3# u6 chhut7-miaNi1 cho5 khang1-khoe5# kha1-chhiu3# chiok kin3=ebok8-cheng2# kok7-lai6# chhi6-tiuN2# siau-loo6# siaN3-khoan3chit8-tiuN-phoe1# kia5-khi5-bi3-kok7# goa6-che6pivot-nouns (often w/u6): u6-ki1-hoe6 # V (pivot?); u6 phai5 ki1-su1# chu6-chhiuN3# cho5-chi3-to7-oan5u6 kian5-pun3# bian3-hui5# toa6 cheng6-sang5The pivot noun behaves simultaneously as object and subject, and displays the sandhi juncture typical of a subject. As with regular subject-pronouns, pivot pronouns do undergo tone change.: chhoa6 goa3 kiaN2=chit=paikau5-goa3 hioh7-khun5B. Between coordinate items and before any connective particles.1. Between coordinate phrases (thoan2-tsong1# chiap7-tai6).2. Before temporal connectives between phrases (to6, chiu6, chiah7, chiah7-koh7)3. Between lists of nouns, numeralsbetween pairs of numerals (phone numbers, etc.). Some people break numbers into groups of three. 7 digits: 3+2+2, 2+2+3 (much rarer). 8 digits: 2+2+2+2, 2+3+3.4. Between coordinate verbs/adjectives, also before the connective koh7. Cheng3-che2 # koh7 u6 oe6-seng1.siu6-phai5# khi5 pai5-hong3 i1lai2-khi5 goan3-tau1# thit7-tho2khi5 kong1-si1# siong6-pan1lu3 kui5# lu3 ho3 (but cf. lu3-lai2-lu3-, which has become grammaticalized)Subordination in its various forms, principally modification of nouns and verbs,  involves tonal marking in some but not all cases. Adverbs of time and place are tonallymarked . "Place" includes examples where PW ends in directional suffix (lai6, teng3, etc.).siaN3-mih7 si2-kan# beh7-khi5Similarly, there is a sandhi boundary at the end of the duration-phrase in a sentence of the form Òhave not V-ed in [length of time].Ó Form: [duration]# bo2-v. Examples: chit8-ni2# bo2-lai2chin1-ku3# bo2-VsaN1-ni2-lai6# e6 koh7-khi3=chit=paiCoverb phrases (consisting of a coverb and its object) function adverbially and are tonally marked, except when a  pronoun is the object (in which case it is unmarked). goa3 kah7 peng2-iu3# teh7 kong3-oe6i1 ka6 tai6-chi5# kong3 hoa6 thiaN1Ka6 goan2-liau6# khng5#=jip=khiiong6 ki1-khi5# chiat7-seng3 jin2-lek8ti6 chhi6-tiuN2# siau1-loo6# chin1 ho3hak8-hau6# li6 goan3-tau1# bo2-hiah7-huiN6Most adverbs other than time and place, that is those describing manner, do not have a sandhi boundary. Tone change ordinarily occurs at the end of them: hiam3+a 'almost, very nearly'tu3-tu3 / tu3-tu3+a 'just now'poo6-poo6 'continually, over and over'uiN1+a 'really, truly' (< u6+iaN3)kan3+a 'apparently'kan1-na1 'only'tiaN6(-tiaN6) 'often'chiap8 'hurriedly'sui2 'immediately'liam2-mi1 'in a moment'an3-choaN3 'how?'eng3-koe5+aput7-chi3+a 'rather, quite'In other words, there are two classes of adverbs: adverbs in general are unmarked, but adverbs of time (including length of time not V-ed) and place, as well as adverbial phrases consisting of a coverb and object, are marked. I feel that the marked state is similar to the sh“Éde  pattern The speaker can emphasize an adverb by placing a juncture boundary after it. My impression is that this effect is more common with words of learned origin, which are often but not always calques of Mandarin forms.chin1-chiaN5choat8-tui5khak7-sit8i3-keng1ki2-sit8sui2-jian2lim2-si2There are some adverbs (mostly of learned origin) that my informants say never undergo tone-change:tai6-khai3 # (no change); but dist. tai6-khai3+along3-chong3 # (us. no change)bian3-hui5# su6-sit8-siong6 'in truth'bok8-cheng2#kok7-lai6# I believe their lack of tone change makes them sound more formal, and thus reinforces their learned quality. Adverbs appearing within 4-character idioms generally end in a sandhi juncture: to1-to1# chi3-kau5Modifiers of a noun (including  possession) are marked by an unchanged tone in their final syllable.Possession and modification are most often  expressed using the particle e2.lau6-su1# e2-chhu5chit8-khoo1# e2-gin2-kak7+aLong modifiers sometimes appear without e2 but are nevertheless marked tonally: choan2-chu6-tong6-hua5# ki1-khi5li3 chim3+a teh7 khoaN5# chit7 kui3 khoan3 san3-phin3Discrete semantic units within a compound phrase are also sometimes marked tonally, especially proper nouns within a compound noun phrase. Examples: uan3-tong1# pah7-hoe5-kong1-si1 (Yeuandong Baehuohgongsy); Jit8-pun3# hong1-bin6Some number-expressions containing more than one  have the  larger units marked:Chit8-tiam3 # saN1-chap8-hun1 but Chit8-tiam3-poaN5saN1-ban6# saN1-chheng1# saN1-pah7 saN1-chap8-saN1Nouns preceding directional suffixes are considered to modify them and are therefore marked:chhut7-kok# chin5-chengtu2-liau3 thau2 chit8 khoan3# i3-goa6...lin3-chhu5# goa6-khau3
