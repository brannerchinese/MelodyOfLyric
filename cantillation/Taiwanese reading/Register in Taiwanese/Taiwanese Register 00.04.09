The Taiwanese Reading Accent and its CultureDavid Prager BrannerAn earlier version of this paper was presented as ÒArtificial Character Readings vs. Natural Ancient Words in Living TaiwaneseÓ at the Yuen Ren Society Symposium on the History of Spoken Chinese, held in conjunction with the 210th meeting of the American Oriental Society, 13 March, 2000.Register: spoken vs. written.use of ÒwrittenÓ words in speech (©¿µM¶¡, ¦ı¬O, ·íµM, etc.; individual upper-register loanwords)compare use of English in Mandarin, use of Mandarin in Taiwanese, earlier use of Japanese in Taiwanese.some effect on Taiwanese mispronunciations of educated terms, including placenames (ke÷3-be3 for ke÷3-bi3, bak8-tsa6 for bak8-sa6).aside: clear consciousness of register differences in pre-modern literature (not only wen-bair ¤å¥Õ distinction in novels, drama, but also more fundamental to the didactic voice in classical prose)cherngyeu ¦¨»y. not nec. literary accent, but literary register.

Inherent value: Reflects late imperial literate culture.claim: Best voice in which to read classical literature. (Note: traditionally used for all pre-modern literature.)problems:No one system is historically accurate for all periods.This particular system does not follow the medieval system closelyLoss of readings that are necessary to organization of the literature. (¦})Unnecessary distinctions created (e.g. Mandarin ruhsheng)Necessary distinctions not made.Absolute sound of pre-modern literature is only distantly represented.consolations:The use of the literary accent is historically accurate as a way of reading aloud.Outside of Taiwan, literary accent seems to have strongly influenced early forms of local Mandarin.Three kinds of sound in Chinese classical literatureutility of reconstructionwe use reconstr. to depict sounds we cannot hearin literature, we always say we want to get an idea of the ÒoriginalÓ sound of a workactually, no one reconstr. is enough for thisno one reconstr. can give us the actual sound of a specific moment in historyalso because the way sounds have meaning in language is complex ÒbasicÓ vs. non-basic words in dialectologythe language in literature is kept alive by the viablity of its induction into modern speechquestion of the Òlinguistic intentionÓ of the author, vs. our readingsBeethoven & metronomeinvented in his lifetime, and he issued metr. values for all his published work, but contemporary biographers record that when he played he did not observe those values.Bach interpretations/transcripts of Tausig, Busoni, Godowski Ñ not authentic Bach per se, but an authentic historical way of presenting Bach. Also has aesthetic value of its own.supposing there were no Mandarin, what would Taiwanese be like?Examples of Mandarin replacing T bair examples of wen replacing bair in Miinnan (evidence seen comparatively)  k—ng1.
