The Taiwanese Reading Accent and its CultureDavid Prager BrannerSources of data: Reading of classical texts by Mr. Niž KŽng-hui [Liang Jeonghui] ±ç¬³½÷ of Tainan.The Analects of Confucius and the ChiantzyhÕwen ¤d¦r¤å. The thousand characters in the ChiantzyhÕwen are used for the phonological study below..  Phonology.Examination of the traditional claim that the Taiwanese reading is the best and most authentic voice in which to read classical literature. Does the rhyming system preserve all medieval distinctions (all pertinent medieval distinctions?) or does it merely avoid introducing new distinctions?The canonical medeival system emphasises fine distinctions. If the goal in reading is to reproduce the ideal and absolute sound of early medieval times, then the more of these distinctions are made, the better. However, if the goal of reading is simply to produce a literary accent that does not violate rhyming rules, then it not necessary to preserve a large number of distinctions. It is enough only to avoid introducing new distinctions.Problem : The medieval system of rimes as reflected in Taiwanese			kaikoou (absence of {-w-})			herkoou (presence of {-w-})	sheh	1-deeng		2-deeng	3/4-deeng	1-deeng	2-deeng	3/4-deeng	indep. 4-deeng	{e}	o				o	{au}	o		au	iau	{ei}	ai		=1	e	ue~ui	=1		ue~ui	{uo}	¯			u	{ou}	¯			iu	{i}				i/u (by initial)				ui	{a}			a	ia		ua	{am}	am/ap		=1	iam/iap	{an}	an/at		=1	ian/iat	uan/uat	=1		uan/uat (3)	ian/iat(4)	{ong}	a÷/ak	{ang}	o÷/ok			io÷/iok	o÷/Ñ			o÷/Ñ	{ung}	o÷/ok			io÷/iok	{em}				im/ip	{en}	un/ut			in/ it~ek	un/Ñ			un/ut (many exceptions)	{eng}	e÷/ek			e÷/ ek~it				Ñ/ok	{eing}			=3	e÷/ek		=3		e÷/ek.

But the shaangsheng is less neat. For one thing, sonorant initials {m}, {n}, {l}, {ny}, {ng}, and {y} generally remain in tone 3:	¬ü bi3 {miQ3c}		¦Õ z“`3 {nyiQ3d}	º¡ buan3 {mwanQ1}		¬V ziam3 {nyamQ3b}	¦Ñ lo3 {lauQ1}		¤Þ in3 {yenQ3b}	¨â lio÷3 {langQ3}		¥H i3 {yiQ3d}	¤k lu3 {nuoQ3b}		»y gu3 {nguoQ3b}	¤D na`i3 {neiQ1a}		¥õ gio÷3 {ngangQ3}This is typical of Northern (Mandarin and Mandarin-influenced) phonology. Second, initial {gh} remains in tone 3 {in the 3-deeng (i.e., if its reflex in Taiwanese reading accent is zero), but it appears in tone 6 otherwise.	¦³ iu3 {ghouQ3b}	©¹ o÷3 {ghwangQ3}	»· uan3 {ghwanQ3a}	¤á h¯6 {ghuoQ1}	©¯ he÷6 {gheingQ2b}	º× ho6 {ghweQ1}There are also words that have readings in both the shaang and chiuh tones and voiced initials. Taiwanese character readings do not distinguish the two medieval tone categories under these conditions, so we cannot tell which reading is which.}	³Q pi6 {biQ3b}, {biH3b}	¤W sio÷6 {dzyangQ3}, {dzyangH3}	§Ì te6 {deiQ4}, {deiH4}	ªñ kun6 {genQ3a}, {genH3a}	¸ü tsai6 {tseiQ1a tseiH1a}	¤U ha6 {ghaQ2}, {ghaH2}	¦b tsai6 {dzeiQ1a}, {dzeiH1a}	«á h¯6 {ghouQ1}, {ghouH1}	§¤ tso6 {dzweQ1}, {dzweH1}	®L ha6 {ghaQ2}, {ghaH2}	»E tsu6 {dzuoQ3c}, {dzuoH3c}Problem : Failed rhyming in classical textsExample : Exceptional modern values fail to rhyme as expected	Rhyme-word in:text		Taiwanese	Medieval	Mandarin´º¦æºû½å¡B§J©À§@¸t	se÷5	syeingH3b	shenq¼w«Ø¦W¥ß¡B§ÎºÝªí¥¿	tse÷5	tsyeingH3b	jenqªÅ¨¦¶ÇÁn¡Bµê°ó²ßÅ¥	the÷5	theingH4	tinqº×¦]´c¿n¡BºÖ½tµ½¼y	khe÷5	kheingH3a	chinq¤ØÂz«DÄ_¡B¤oª÷¬OÄv	ke÷6	geingH3a	jinq¸ê¤÷¨Æ§g¡B¤êÄY»P·q	ke÷5	keingH3a	jinq§µ·íºÜ¤O¡B©¾«hºÉ©R	be÷6	meingH3a	minqÁ{²`¼iÁ¡¡B¦g¿³·ÅÐá	tshe÷5	tsheingH3b	chinq¦üÄõ´µÄÉ¡B¦pªQ¤§²±	se÷6	dzyeingH3b	shenq¤t¬y¤£®§¡B²W¼á¨ú¬M	io÷5	eingH3a	yinq®e¤î­Y«ä¡B¨¥Ãã¦w©w	te÷6	deingH4	dinq¿wªì¸Û¬ü¡B·V²×©y¥O	le÷6	leingH3b	linqºa·~©Ò°ò¡BÄy¬ÆµL³º	ke÷5	keingH3a	jinq¾ÇÀuµn¥K¡BÄáÂ¾±q¬F	tse÷5	tsyeingH3b	jenq¦s¥H¥Ì´Å¡B¥h¦Ó¯qµú	e÷6	ghweingH3a	yeongThe reading io÷5 for ¬M appears to be correct; at any rate, the expected *e÷5 is not attested in the main Jangjou character dictionaries:Shieh Shiowlan, Hueyin yeaswutong shyrwuuin: ia÷5 (char.), ia`5 (colloq.); no reading given under *e÷5 (®|­^) or *io÷5 (¨Ñ­^).William Campbell, Shiahmen in shin tzyhdean: io÷5 (char.), ia`5 (colloq.), ia`1 (colloq.).Sheen Fuhjinn, Hueyin baojiann: ia÷5 (char.),io÷5 (colloq.), ia`5 (colloq.). All mean the same.Chern Baodean, Tairyeu hueyin: ia÷5, io÷5 (does not distinguish character readings).Mandarin has more problems than Taiwanese, because it uses two different vowels depending on the nature of the initial. The Mandarin reading of µú yeong is irregular (and evidently influenced by the phonetic element yeong ¥Ã); ghweingH3a is expected to give a reading *yinq. Example : Ruhsheng rhyming	Rhyme-word in:text		Taiwanese	Medieval	Mandarinªv¥»©ó¹A¡B°È¯÷½[Â¨	sek7	srek3	sehÐÔ¸ü«n¯a¡B§ÚÃÀ¶Á½^	tsek7	tsek3	jihµ|¼ô°^·s¡BÄU½àÂJÔF	thek7	trek3	jyh©s¶a´°¯À¡B¥v³½ªÃª½	tit8	drek3	jyr±f´X¤¤±e¡B³ÒÁ¾ÂÔ±Õ	thek7	threk3	chyh²â­µ¹î²z¡BÅ³»ª¿ë¦â	sek7	srek3	seh¶M³Ö¹Å·ß¡B«j¨ä¬k´Ó	sit8	dzyek3	jyr¬Ù°`ÃÕ»|¡BÃd¼W§Ü·¥	kek8	gek3	jyi¬p°dªñ®¢¡BªL¯o©¯§Y	tsek7	tsek3	jyi¨â²¨¨£¾÷¡B¸Ñ²Õ½Ö¹G	pek7	pek3	bia. Mandarin has serious problems handling ruhsheng rhyming, because it creates many distinctions within what are supposed to be whole rhyming categories. Here it rhymes together six different finals, spread over three different tone categories.b. In literary Taiwanese there is less difficulty, but there is still confusion between et3 andek3 . Below are two sets of words; those on the left have an expected -t ending in Taiwanese, but there are some examples of -k. On the right are words where -k is expected, but there are several examples of -t. The alternation of endings may be conditioned by medieval initial type.Character	Taiwanese	Medieval	Character	Taiwanese	Medieval³ü	it7	et3b	¹G	pek7	pek3¥²µ§	pit7	pet3b	¤O	lek8	lek3¹ê	sit8	zyet3b	ÔF	thek7	trek3±K	bit8	met3b	±Õ	thek7	threk3¤é	zit8	nyet3b	§Y½^	tsek7	tsek3			¦âÂ¨	sek7	srek3			®§	sek7	sek3			ÌÊ	tsek7	tsrek3¦N	kiat7	ket3b	´l	tshek7	tshrek3			·¥	kek8	gek3·æ	sek7	sret3c	ª½	tit8	drek3º£	tshek7	tshet3b	Â¾	tsit7	tsyek3¶h	ek8	yet3b	´ÓØÓ	sit8	dzyek3			­¹	sit8	zyek3Problem : Failed rhyming within classical textsExample : ChiantzyhÕwen ¤d¦r¤å read by ±ç¬³½÷ (of Tainan)³£¨¶µØ®L¡BªF¦è¤G¨Ê	ke÷1	Ãm»·TÂä¡BÅÉ©¦ªH­ß	be÷2­IÊQ­±¬¥¡B¯B´ô¾Ú®ù	ke÷1	µ¦¥\­Z¹ê¡B°Ç¸O¨è»Ê	be÷2®c·µ½LÆ{¡B¼ÓÆ[­¸Åå	ke÷1	í¨·Ë¥ì¤¨¡B¦õ®Éªü¿Å	he÷2¹Ï¼g¸VÃ~¡Bµe±m¥PÆF	le÷2	©a¦v¦±ªú¡B·L¥¹±EÀç	e÷2¤þªÙ³Ä±Ò¡B¥Ò±b¹ï·­	e÷2	®Ù¤½¦J¦X¡BÀÙ®z§ß¶É	khe÷1¸vºá³]®u¡B¹ª·æ§j²Æ	se÷1	ºöSº~´f¡B»¡·PªZ¤B	te÷1°¥¶¥¯Ç°¡¡B¥¯ÂàºÃ¬P	se÷1	«TÉ@±K¤Å¡B¦h¤hØÓ¹ç	le÷2¥k³q¼s¤º¡B¥ª¹F©Ó©ú	be÷2	®Ê·¡§óÅQ¡B»¯ÃQ§x¾î	he÷2¬J¶°¼X¨å¡B¥ç»E¸s­^	e÷1	°²³~·Àç~¡B½î¤g·|·ù	be÷2§ù½ZÁéÁõ¡Bº£®ÑÂz¸g	ke÷1	¦ó¿í¬ùªk¡BÁú¹ú·Ð¦D	he÷2©²Ã¹±N¬Û¡B¸ô«Lºi­ë	khe÷1	°_°Å»áªª¡B¥Î­x³Ìºë	tse÷1¤á«Ê¤K¿¤¡B®aµ¹¤d§L	pe÷1	«Å«Â¨Fºz¡B¹£ÅA¤¦«C	tshe÷1°ª«a³­½û¡BÅXÁÔ®¶ÅÕ	e÷1	¤E¦{¬ê¸ñ¡B¦Ê°p¯³¦}	pe÷5¥@¸S¨×´I¡B¨®¾rªÎ»´	khe÷1	À®©v®õ©§¡BÁI¥D¤ª«F	te÷2©ø¦ÀºÔ¥Û¡B¹d³¥¬}®x	te÷2	¶­ªùµµ¶ë¡BÂû¥Ð¨ª«°	se÷2Note that the reading *pe÷1 is canonically associated only with city of Bingjou ¦}¦{.

Taiwanese character-readings regularly use hu- where Mandarin has f-, but Mandarin w (< *m) has failed to establish a separate initial category. This gives the impression of conservatism.	¤`	bo÷2	mang3	°Ý	bun6	mwenH3a	¤Å	but8	mwet3a	±ß	buan3	manQ3a	¤å	bun2	mwen3a	µL	bu2	muo3c	§Ñ	bo÷2	mang3	·L	bi2	mi3a	ªZ	bu3	muoQ3c	¸U	ban6	manH3a	ªÉ	bo÷3	mangQ3	»D	bun2	mwen3a	°È	bu6	muoH3c	Conclusion: All in all, literary Taiwanese is a poor vehicle for medieval phonology of any era..  Syntax	The interest in this subject is that Literary Taiwanese, like the spoken language, uses tone-sandhi rules to distinguish some grammatical categories within the sentence. . Notation	Parts of speech will be marked:		S:	Subject		VI:	Inactive (instransitive) Verb 		O:	Object			VA:	Active (transitive) Verb		N:	Noun			V-say:	Verb introducing direct quotation		Mod:	Modifier		V-exist: Verb of existence (¦³µL)		PL:	Placeword		Adv:	Adverb		Pron:	Pronoun		Aux:	Auxiliary Verb		Neg:	Negative		Punct:	Punctuation Particle		Num:	Numeral		Nominalizer: ªÌ		Subord: Subordinating Particle (¦Ó)		<Ñ:	indicates that a syllable is part of a compound with the preceding syllable.		Cov:	Coverb (takes an object, together with which it forms an adverbial phrase)	Only syllables that are unchanged by tone sandhi are marked, by the symbol Ò#Ó. Where tone sandhi produces a new contour that can only be associated with a single underlying tone category, no special notations are made. Where tone sandhi produces an ambiguity as to which of two or more underlying tone categories the affected syllable belongs to, both categories are listed. In the literary accent this is usually seen only in the case of tones 1 and 2, which are indistinguishable in sandhi.	Where the reader pauses briefly, a comma Ò,Ó is used in the transscription.  Where the reader pauses for a long time, drawing out the last syllable and gradually dropping the pitch, a long dash ÒÑÓ is used.. Sandhi rules reflecting syntax	. The Òtone-sandhiÓ form of a syllable is heard more often than the ÒunderlyingÓ form, because a syllable is only pronounced without sandhi when it is the last syllable of a phrase. Unless it is the last syllable of a phrase, it undergoes sandhi. The sandhi boundary is marked with the symbol Ò#Ó. This symbol placed after the number of a syllable means that that syllable does not undergo tone sandhi, and occurs before a sandhi boundary.	. If the sentence can be analyzed into Topic + Comment, there is a sandhi boundary at the end of the Topic. Often the Topic is the semantic subject of the sentence; after the subject there is a sandhi-boundary. That is, the last syllable of the subject phrase does not undergo sandhi. However, if the subject is a one-syllable pronoun, it does not undergo sandhi.	. The end of a coverb phrase, meaning the end of the object of the coverb, has a sandhi boundary. Consider Modern Taiwanese (Ilan accent):  		a12 tsin1#	ui57	tai12	lam2#	lai2#	a0		S		[ Cov	O	<Ñ ]	VI	Punct		ÒA-tsin	from	Tainan	come	[completed]Ó		A-tsin has come from T‰il‰m.	. The subordinating/coordinating particle ¦Ó is ordinarily preceded by a sandhi-boundary, by which we understand that this particle is felt to divide two phrases.	. Sentence-final particles (ÒpunctuationÓ particles ¤], ¨o, ¥G, Âj, etc.) and the nominalizing/topic-marking particle ªÌ are ordinarily toneless and preceded by a sandhi-boundary. 	. The particle ¤§, when it serves to connect a modifier to a following noun, is preceded by a sandhi-boundary. It can thus be distinguished from the use of ¤§ as a pronoun functioning as a direct object, which is not preceded by a sandhi-boundary.	. When an adverb appears describing the place where an action takes place, it ordinarily follows the verb in Classical Chinese. Literary Taiwanese interposes a sandhi-boundary between verb and place:		kim1#	se÷1#Ñ	le6	sui3#		S	VI	PL	<Ñ		ÒGold	born	Lih RiverÓ		Gold is produced in the Lih RiverÉHere is an example from the Analects containing three sandhi-boundaries, not counting the end of the phrase:		§^	¤é	¤T	¬Ù	§^	¨­		÷¯`2#Ñ	zit8#	sam12	se÷3#	÷¯`12	sin1		S	Adv1	Adv2	VA	Mod	O		Topic1	Topic2	Verb-phrase	Place-phrase		ÒI	day	three	reflect	I	selfÓ		ÒEvery day I examine myself with respect to three thingsÉÓThere is a sandhi-boundary after each of the two topics, and (somewhat unusually) also after the verb, evidently because the object ÒmyselfÓ is being treated as an adverb of place.. Example from the ÒChiantzyhÕwenÓ	Below are the first 12 (of 125) lines of the ÒChiantzyhÕwen ¤d¦r¤åÓ. This rather silly text is attributed to Jou Shingsyh ©P¿³¶à (fl. 6th century), who wrote it while in prison. Its distinguishing feature is that each of its thousand characters appears only once. However, many of the characters are used in unusual ways, making it a poor introduction to classical language. It has remained alive chiefly as a vehicle for calligraphy and as a childrenÕs primer. It is organized into regular rhyming couplets, four-characters per line. As with other four-character writing, there is a regular c¾sura after the second syllable of each line, but notice that this c¾sura does not necesssarily correspond to a sandhi-boundary (e.g., couplets  7, 8, and 11).	thian12	te6#Ñ	hian12	ho÷2#	u3	tiu6#Ñ	ho÷12	ho÷1#	¤Ñ¦a¥È¶À¦t©z¬x¯î	S1	S2	VI1+	VI2	S1+	S2	VI1	VI2	Heaven and Earth are dark and yellow; time and space are overflowing and boundless.	zit8	guat8#,	e÷12	tsek7#	sin12	siu5#Ñ	liat8	tio÷1#	¤é¤ë¬ÕÌÊ¨°±J¦C±i	S1+	S2	VI1+	VI2	S1+	S2	VI1+	VI2	Sun and moon wax and wane; stars and constellations are arrayed and spread out.	han2#	lai2#Ñ	su3#	o÷3#	tshiu1#	siu1#Ñ	to÷1#	tso÷2#	´H¨Ó´»©¹¬î¦¬¥VÂÃ	S1+	VI1	S2	VI2	S1+	VI1	S2	VI2	Winter comes, summer goes; in autumn we harvest, in winter we store.	zun6	u2#Ñ	se÷12	sue5#	lut8	lu6#Ñ	tiau12	io÷2#	¶|¾l¦¨·³«ß§f½Õ¶§	S	<Ñ	VA	O	S	<Ñ	VA	O	The excess of the leap-months forms a year; the twelve pitch-pipes adjust the musical keys.	un2#	te÷2#Ñ	ti5	u3#	l¯6#	kiat7#,	ui12	so÷1#	¶³ÄË­P«BÅSµ²¬°Á÷	S	VI	VA	O	S	VI	VA	O	Clouds leap, and bring forth rain; dew coagulates, and becomes frost.	kim1#	se÷1#Ñ	le6	sui3#	giok8#	tshut7#,	khun12	ko÷1#	ª÷¥ÍÄR¤ô¥É¥X±X©£	S	VI	PL	<Ñ	S	VI	PL	<Ñ	Gold is produced in the Lih River; jade comes from the Kuenshan mountains.	kiam5#	ho6Ñ	ku6	khuat7#	tsu1#	tshe÷12Ñ	ia6	ko÷1#	¼C¸¹¥¨Âö¯]ºÙ©]¥ú	S	V-say	N	<Ñ	S	V-say	N	<Ñ	A great sword is named ÒGiant TowerÓ; a great jewel is called ÒNight brillianceÓ.	ko3#	tin12Ñ	li3	na`i6#	tshai5#	tio÷6Ñ	kai5	kio÷1#	ªG¬Ã§õÏUµæ­«ªãÁ¤	S	VA	O1	O2	S	VA	O1	O2	Among fruit, we treasure plum and pear; among vegetables we value mustard and ginger.	hai3#	ham2#Ñ	ho2#	tam6#	lin2#	tsiam2#Ñ	u3#	sio÷2#	®üÄÐªe²HÅì¼ç¦Ðµ¾	S1	VI1	S2	VI2	S1	VI1	S2	VI2	The sea is salty, the Yellow River fresh; things with scales submerge, things with feathers soar.	lio÷12	su1#Ñ	h¯3	te5#	nia`u3	kuan1#Ñ	zin12	ho÷2#	Às®v¤õ«Ò³¾©x¤H¬Ó	N1	<Ñ	N2	<Ñ	N1	<Ñ	N2	<Ñ		The ÒDragon MastersÓ, ÒBringer of FireÓ; ÒBird Officials}, ÒHuman August OneÓ.

Analects	Real Classical texts are challenging to chant because their lines are not all the same length. But the variation produced by that unevenness gives guuwen ¥j¤å prose a characteristic sound that makes it memorable and beautiful. For a young student reading an unpunctuated text in traditional times, the teacherÕs pauses and tone sandhi would have served to help break impenetrable pages of text into manageable phrases, and to parse the grammar in a rough way.	¤l	¤ê	¡B	§^	¤Q	¦³	¤­	¦Ó	§Ó	¤_	¾Ç	tsu3#	uat8,		÷¯`2#Ñ	sip8#	iu6	÷¯`3Ñ	zi12	tsi5	u12	hak8#,	S	V-say		S-Pron	Num	ÔplusÕ	Num	Subord	VI	[ Cov	O ]	The Master said, ÒWhen I was 15, I set my ambition on learning.	¤T	¤Q	¦Ó	¥ß	¡B	¥|	¤Q	¦Ó	¤£	´b	sam12	sip8#	zi12	lip8#,		su5	sip8#	zi12	put7	hek8#,	Num	<Ñ	Subord	VI		Num	<Ñ	Subord	Neg	VI	When I was 30 I was established.
