Wenyan Syntax in the Taiwanese Classical Reading AccentDavid Prager BrannerUniversity of Maryland< dpb23@columbia.edu >	It is well known that most Coastal M¥n dialects exhibit complicated sandhi, which affects tone and sometimes also vowel color. This sandhi is evident not only in speech, but also in the traditional practice of reading classical literature in dialect. 	In Taiwanese, which is now the most vital of the living varieties of Southern M¥n, sandhi affects principally tone. The juncture boundaries of Taiwan tone sandhi are well documented for spoken language, but differ somewhat for the classical reading tradition because of the special usages of literary language. In effect, these boundaries serve to parse the sentence grammatically. In the days of traditional education they must have been a useful pedagogical tool, as well as an art form. 	This paper documents the traditional Taiwanese accent for reading classical prose, based on recent recordings of the Analects and other non-poetic classical works in Taiwanese. Âá¥Í¦n¬°¤å¡B«ä¤§¦Ü²`¡B¥H¬°¤åªÌ®ð¤§©Ò«¬¡BµM¤å¤£¥i¥H¾Ç¦Ó¯à¡B®ð¥i¥H¾i¦Ó­P		Ä¬Âá¡B¤W¼Ï±KÁú¤Ó±L®ÑBy nature I love to write, and have considered the matter most deeply: I feel that writing is something in which vital breath takes concrete form. Hence writing cannot be mastered by study, but vital breath can be brought to fulness by cultivation.		SØ Cheh, age 18, Letter to taywey Harn Chyi of the Bureau of Military Affairs
