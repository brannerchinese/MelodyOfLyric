Taiwanese sandhi rules, outtakes 01.08.14. Extent complementsMost verb complements in the spoken language have normal stress, and tones of the syllables preceding them have context values.However, certain verb complements (directional, extent) are unstressed and there is a juncture before them. Note that if the complement is emphatically given its proper tone, the preceding verb will then have a changed tone. .	khoañ3#=chit=pai	V#			Compl	look		once	“to look once” ~ “to have a look”Compare:.	khoañ3	chit8	pai2	V			Compl	look		once	“to look just once”This effect tends appear only with chit8. .	khah4-toa7=chit=sut=a=e.	koh4 chiah8=chit=te ggg checkIf there is a particle between verb and complement then both verb and particle change tones normally. ggg what?Certain particles are normally unstressed. ggg cf. aboveX=tit. .

Marking them by means of a sandhi juncture makes them sound more formal, and thus reinforces their learned quality. It happens that adverbs appearing within 4-character idioms generally end in a sandhi juncture: .	to1-to1# chi2-kau3 	ADV	V	much	provide instruction	“I humbly request your guidance.” (polite).	ggg more examples ggg (Three of these examples — su7-sit8-siong7#, bok8-cheng5#, kok4-lai7# — also contain a directional suffix, making them susceptible to juncture for formal reasons alone.) ggg note grammaticalization of one with +a: tai7-khai2+aThe one example that does not express opinion or summation, bian2-hui3#, is in my view behaving not as an adverb but as a verb phrase in its own right: “[you] do not need to pay”, so that when before another verb it creates a coordinate relationship between the two verb phrases: ggg.	bian2-hui3# 	‘at no cost’*********modification (restore!)Long modifiers sometimes appear without e5 but are nevertheless marked tonally: .	choan5-chu7-tong7-hua3# ki1-khi3.	li2 chit4-ma2 teh4 khoañ3# chit4 kui2 khoan2 san2-phin2Discrete semantic units within a compound phrase are also sometimes marked tonally, especially proper nouns within a compound noun phrase. Examples: .	uan2-tong1# pah4-hoe3-kong1-si1 (Yeuandong Baehuohgongsy); .	Jit8-pun2# hong1-bin7Some number-expressions containing more than one measure word have the larger units marked:.
