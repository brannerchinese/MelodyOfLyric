On Having a TeacherH‡n Ydraft translation by David Prager Branner	In antiquity, a cultured person always had a teacher.	A teacher	was the means for transmitting the truth, learning a trade, and untangling oneÕs ignorance.	Among people who are Ònot born knowing the truthÓ;	who can be without ignorance?	But if one is ignorant and does not submit oneself to a teacher,	as for that ignorance Ñ	never will it lessen.	Someone born before me Ñ	as for the truth he has learned,	of course it ranks before what I have learned;	submitting myself, I take him as my teacher.	Someone born after me Ñ	as for the truth he has learned,	if it ranks ahead of what I have learned,	submitting myself, I take him as my teacher.	When I seek someone to teach me the truth,	why, how can I know whether that person will have been born before or after me?	Therefore	there is no rank, high or low;	there is no age, old or young.	Where truth is,	there the teacher is.	Alas!	The way of the teacher has been left untransmitted Ñ	for so long now!	To wish that people should be without ignorance Ñ	how hard that would be!	And the sages of antiquity Ñ 	they surpassed the people around them,	by such great lengths!	Yet, submitting themselves to teachers, they inquired of them.	Ordinary people today	are beneath the sages,	also by great lengths.	And they think it a disgrace to seek instruction from a teacher!	Therefore	the sage grows ever more sagely,	and the fool ever more foolish.	The reason a sage becomes a sage,	and the reason a fool becomes a fool Ñ	might not both facts derive from this one reason?	If you love your children,	you instruct them, choosing a teacher.	As for yourself,	to think it a disgrace to to seek instruction	is ignorance!	That childrenÕs teacher	is someone who instructs them in writing and drills them in where to break between lines.	He is not what I mean by Òone who transmits truth	and untangles ignoranceÓ.	But if it is a choice between not knowing where to break between lines	and not filling in the gaps in oneÕs understanding Ñ	to seek a teacher for one	and not for the other Ñ	to study the little things and leave out the big things Ñ	I have never been able to see the intelligence in that!	Shamans, musicians, and people in various crafts	see no shame in learning from each other.	But among scholars and noblemen and such people Ñ	if two of them were to talk of ÒteacherÓ and ÒstudentÓ and so on,	other people would gather around and snicker about it.	You ask them why. They say:	This one and that one are close in age;	what they know is about the same.	But if the one giving instruction is of low rank, it is considered an embarrassment.	And if the one giving instruction  is advanced in his career, it borders on fawning.	Alas!	The way of the teacher cannot be revived Ñ	that much is evident!	The shamans, musicians, and people in the crafts	the ÒgentlemanÓ regards as not his equals.	Yet in our age, the gentlemanÕs wisdom does not equal theirs.	IsnÕt that peculiar?	The sages did not have steady teachers.	Confucius studied under Lord T‡n, Ch‡ngh—ng, Master XiÁng, and Old DÁn.	As for Lord T‡nÕs followers,	none of them reached to ConfuciusÕ level.	But Confucius said,	ÒIf three people are walking together,	I can surely learn from one of them.Ó	And so	student need not be below the level of teacher,	nor need teacher be wiser than student.	Learning the truth is a matter of precedence,	and technical fields have specialized knowledge,	it is the same thing, no more.	F‡n, son of the L¥ clan,	in his 17th year,	is a lover of old books	and well-practiced in the six gentlemanly arts and the classics and commentaries.	Not bound by the fads of his day,	he has come to study with me.	I appreciate his ability to practice the ancient ways,	and so have written this essay On Having a Teacher for him.	¥j¤§¾ÇªÌ¥²¦³®v	®vªÌ	©Ò¥H¶Ç¹D¨ü·~¸Ñ´b¤]	¤H«D¥Í¦Óª¾¤§ªÌ	±E¯àµL´b	´b¦Ó¤£±q®v	¨ä¬°´b¤]	²×¤£¸Ñ¨o	¥Í¥G§^«e	¨ä»D¹D¤]	©T¥ı¥G§^	§^±q¦Ó®v¤§	¥Í¥G§^«á	¨ä»D¹D¤]	¥ç¥ı¥G§^	§^±q¦Ó®v¤§	§^®v¹D¤]	¤Ò±eª¾¨ä¦~¤§¥ı«á¥Í©ó§^¥G	¬O¬G	µL¶QµL½â	µLªøµL¤Ö	¹D¤§©Ò¦s	®v¤§©Ò¦s¤]	¶Ø¥G	®v¹D¤§¤£¶Ç¤]¤[¨o	±ı¤H¤§µL´b¤]Ãø¨o	¥j¤§¸t¤H	¨ä¥X¤H¤]»·¨o	µS¥B±q®v¦Ó°İ²j	¤µ¤§²³¤H	¨ä¤U¸t¤H¤]¥ç»·¨o	¦Ó®¢¾Ç©ó®v	¬O¬G	¸t¯q¸t	·M¯q·M	¸t¤H¤§©Ò¥H¬°¸t	·M¤H¤§©Ò¥H¬°·M	¨ä¬Ò¥X©ó¦¹¥G	·R¨ä¤l	¾Ü®v¦Ó±Ğ¤§	©ó¨ä¨­¤]	«h®¢®v²j	´b¨o	©¼µ£¤l¤§®v	±Â¤§®Ñ¦Ó²ß¨ä¥yÅªªÌ¤]	«D§^©Ò¿×¶Ç¨ä¹D	¸Ñ¨ä´bªÌ¤]	¥yÅª¤§¤£ª¾	´b¤§¤£¸Ñ	©Î®v²j	©Î¤£²j	¤p¾Ç¦Ó¤j¿ò	§^¥¼¨£¨ä©ú¤]	§ÅÂå¼Ö®v¦Ê¤u¤§¤H	¤£®¢¬Û®v	¤h¤j¤Ò¤§±Ú	¤ê®v¤ê§Ì¤l¤ªªÌ	«h¸s»E¦Ó¯º¤§	°İ¤§«h¤ê	©¼»P©¼¦~¬Û­Y¤]	¹D¬Û¦ü¤]	¦ì¨õ«h¨¬²Û	©x²±«hªñ½Û	¶ã©I	®v¹D¤§¤£´_¥iª¾¨o	§ÅÂå¼Ö®v¦Ê¤u¤§¤H	§g¤l¤£¾¦	¤µ¨ä´¼¤D¤Ï¤£¯à¤Î	¨ä¥i©Ç¤]Âj	¸t¤HµL±`®v	¤Õ¤l®v×è¤lµç¥°®vÁ¸¦Ñ×C	×è¤l¤§®{	¨ä½å¤£¤Î¤Õ¤l	¤Õ¤l¤ê	¤T¤H¦æ	¥²¦³§Ú®v	¬O¬G	§Ì¤l¤£¥²¤£¦p®v	®v¤£¥²½å©ó§Ì¤l	»D¹D¦³¥ı«á	³N·~¦³±M§ğ	¦p¬O¦Ó¤w	§õ¤ó¤lÂÏ	¦~¤Q¤C	¦n¥j¤å	¤»ÃÀ¸g¶Ç¬Ò³q²ß¤§	¤£©ë©ó®É	¾Ç©ó§E	§E¹Å¨ä¯à¦æ¥j¹D	§@®v»¡¥H¶M¤§Reading and chanting of harn Yuh's Shyshuo by Horng Tzernan et al.notes:In chanting, yangpyng seems to be distinguished from inpyng in sandhi by slight tremelo. Not always heard, but also not rare.  it is not so much a sandhi form as a feature of a prolonged syllable - allows him not to have to do the whole long thingwith tone2.sec. 1:  shwu neng wu huoh. siok7# leng2-bu2 hek8.  here bu2 has it. zi2 often has it.  *********tone 1, when prolonged, tends to fall off in pitch.sec 1: su1 in  huoh erl buh tsorngshy. hek8# zi2~ put7-tsiong12-su1-sec 1:  tsiong1 in jong bujiee yii. tsiong1#- put7-kai3# i0*****************sec. 1:  guu jy shyuejee bih yeou shy:  koo3# chi1 hak8-tsia3# , pit7-iu3 su1sec 1:
