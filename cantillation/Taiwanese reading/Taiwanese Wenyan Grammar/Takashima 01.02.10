Dr. K. TakashimaDepartment of Asian StudiesUniversity of British Columbia1871 West MallVancouver, BC   V6T 1Z2  CANADA10 February, 2001Dear Dr. Takashima,	I wish to submit the enclosed abstract to be considered for the conference on Classical Chinese Grammar that you have advertised on the Taiwan Linguist List (15 Jan 2001). I am happy to know that such a conference is being held regularly; I think I would have submitted papers to its earlier incarnations had I known about it.		Cordially yours,			David Branner
