IntroductionIt is well known that most Coastal M•n dialects exhibit complicated sandhi, which affects tone and sometimes other features of the syllable. This sandhi is evident not only in speech, but also in the traditional practice of reading classical literature in dialect. In Taiwanese, which is now the most vital of the living varieties of Southern M•n, sandhi affects principally tone. The juncture boundaries of Taiwan tone sandhi are well documented for spoken language, but differ somewhat for the classical reading tradition because of the special usages of literary language. In effect, these boundaries serve to parse the sentence grammatically. In the days of traditional education they must have been a useful pedagogical tool, as well as an art form. This paper documents the traditional Taiwanese accent for reading classical prose, based on recent recordings of the Analects and other non-poetic classical works in Taiwanese. . Notes on data and notationSources of dialect data, including transcription conventions, are explained in full in a section of the same name in the references at the end of this paper. Here I call attention only to a few essential points. First, the “accents” used in the sections on spoken and Classical language are not the same. For spoken Taiwanese, I have followed informants from the countryside of northern Ilan county, a conservative Zh¡ngzh¢u ∫s¶{-type dialect now succumbing to heavy influence from the rest of Taiwan. The rural usage of my informants is somewhat more conservative that than of Ilan city, but below I refer to this dialect as “Ilan” without further explanation.The scholars whose reading and chanting of Classical Chinese I have studied generally use an accent close to that of Amoy ∑H™˘, even if their native accent is different. They are not always completely consistent in the ways they render that accent, but I have always tried to record faithfully what has come from their mouths. Below, I will refer to Classical Chinese using the Taiwanese term “Hànbûn” (∫~§Â).Second, all materials presented in this paper are the result of careful transcription and repeated collation. I am aware that the vagaries of rural Ilan dialect on one hand and the artificial literary accent on the other may be unfamiliar to many native speakers. However, I have made every effort to prepare the most descriptively accurate material possible. Any errors are of course my own responsibility. Third, I take it as axiomatic that data is best represented in ways that adhere closely to its original form, barring specific needs to the contrary. On a practical level that this is a matter of parsimony. It is also a matter of basic linguistic philosophy; I hold that, in matters of linguistic usage, conceptual issues (“theory”) are subordinate to data and derive naturally from the handling of data, rather than the other way around. Accordingly, the grammatical analysis I have provided for my data may seem overly simple, but I hold that it is no more complicated than necessary to account for the study of sandhi.I have not attempted to give a thorough description of spoken Taiwanese or Hànbûn grammar, merely to categorize the basic relationships between sandhi juncture and syntax. All sentences and individual lexical items are numbered in italics. Sentences are first parsed grammatically, then translated literally and finally put into idiomatic English. With some adjustments, romanization generally follows the Church romanization originating with Carstairs Douglas (see Douglas 1873:607-608). Douglas’ original symbols ÿ (generally [Ø]) and ñ  (nasalization) are retained. However, I have replaced tonal diacritics with numerals, as described below.Tones will ordinarily be represented by numerals, according the numbering system traditional in Taiwan:	1 y£npíng	≥±•≠		5 yángpíng	∂ß•≠	2 y£nsh§ng	≥±§W		6 [does not exist]	3 y£nqù	≥±•h		7 yángqù	∂ß•h	4 y£nrù	≥±§J		8 yángrù	∂ß§JTone values and other transcriptional conventions for the Ilan and Hànbûn material are detailed in the References, beginning on p. .I have used two special symbols not usually found in Church romanization. Sandhi-juncture, explained below, is marked by a number-sign (#). In the Hànbûn reading passages, the exclamation point (!) indicates that the preceding syllable is drawn out, which gives the tone the effect of dropping gradually in pitch. There is not necessarily a sandhi juncture at these places; sometimes the use of the prolongation is determined metrically. When applied to the yángpíng at a juncture boundary, the pitch of the syllable rises and then falls, not unlike the sound of the yángqù syllable in Foochow dialect. At times Hung Tzeh-nan likes to give the yángpíng tone this rise-fall effect even without prolonging it.. Stress and sandhi junctureConventional descriptions of Taiwanese and M•nnán dialects emphasize the principle of “tone change”, by which a “basic” tone value is transformed into a “changed” (or “sandhi”) value in context. It has been observed, however, that speakers seem to treat the two values as structural allomorphs mediated by lexicon, and do not actually engage in a productive phonetic process (see the discussion in Myers and Tsai 2001:262-264). In keeping with this observation, it is preferable to use more plainly descriptive terms: the “basic” contour of a tone category will be called its “juncture” value (bi¡njièdiào √‰¨…Ω’) and the “changed” contour its “context” value (yºjìngdiào ªyπ“Ω’). Juncture values are so called because their presence generally marks a syntactic boundary. In an ordinary sentence, whether spoken or literary, the majority of the syllables have context values, and only a few have juncture values. Juncture tone values are phonologically marked, and are indicated in transcription by a number-sign (#) following the tone-number. . Final syllables in generalWith some exceptions, the last normally stressed syllable in a sentence exhibits its juncture tone value..	li2		beh4		khi3	to2-ui7#	[note ]	S		Aux		V		PW#	 you 	 want to 	 go 	 where? 	“Where do you want to go?” (Ilan).	in1		long2		tih4		lai7-te2#	[note ]	S		Adv		V			Direc#	 they 	 [total] 	 [progr] 	 inside 	“They’re all inside” (Ilan)These two sentences contain no unstressed syllables and only the final syllables have context tone values. In Hànbûn, the same rule applies:.	ßg§l				∞»			•ª	kun15-tsu2#	bu7		pun2#	S#					VA		O#	 gentleman 		 duty 		 root  	“The gentleman takes as his responsibility what is basic.” (Analects I:2).	§ÿ¬z				´D		ƒ_			§o	≥±				¨O		ƒv	chhek4-phek4#	hui15	po2#		chhun3-im1# !	si7		keng7#	S#					VA	O#			S#					O		VA#	A foot of jade is no treasure; an inch of shade [on the sundial] — of this you must be cautious. (Qi¡nzìwén 30)The issue of stress is important, because words and syllables can become tonally unstressed (pronounced in the neutral tone) in a number of situations. In the spoken language, one case is sentence-final particles, which are regularly pronounced in the neutral tone and preceded by a syllable in its basic tone:.	a	indicates completed verb aspect; .	bÿ	indicates a simple question; [note ].	le	indicates progressive verb aspect. [note ]In Hànbûn, the familiar aspect, topic-marking, and question particles are generally unstressed. .	πD		§ß			©“¶s				Æv		§ß			©“¶s			§]	to7# 	chi15		sÿ2-tsun5#		su1# 	chi15		sÿ2-tsun5# 	=ia	Mod#	Part		O-VA#			Mod#	Part		O-VA#		Aspect	“Where truth is, there the teacher is.” (“Sh£shu¢”).	§£		•Á		º÷			•G	put4	ek8	lok8#		=hº	Neg	Adv	VI			Q	“Is not that joy?

In mid-phrase, although some of them (e.g., ™Ã, •G) may appear in other senses, they are not unstressed and the syllable preceding them does not have its juncture tone..	•j		§ß		æ«™Ã				•≤		¶≥		Æv	kÿ2#	chi15	hak8 -chia2#	pit4 	iu2 	su1# 	(                   S                )#	Adv	VA	O#	In antiquity, a cultured person always had a teacher.

Here are two clear examples of the use of stress and juncture to distinguish different uses of the same character.. Special cases of “final” syllableWords and syllables can undergo loss of stress in a number of circumstances in the spoken language. The syllable immediately preceding a neutral-tone syllable usually has its juncture value, but there are exceptions.A pronoun as object is usually unstressed in the spoken language, and the preceding syllable has its juncture tone:.	pai3-hong2#	=li	V				Pron	 visit 			 you 	“to pay you a visit” (Ilan).	hÿ7#			=goa	V				Pron	 give 			 me 	“Give it to me.” (Ilan).	m7-bat4#		=i	Neg-V		Pron	 not know 	 him/her 	“[I] don’t know him/her.” (Ilan)That is one of a number of examples in which pronouns behave differently from other nouns in the same environment. In Hànbûn, however, pronouns have their full tone values.	æ‹		Æv			¶”			±–		§ß	tek8 	su1# !		ji5# 		kau3 	chi1# 	VA1	O1#		CONJ#	VA2	O2#	“You instruct [your children], choosing a teacher.” (“Sh£shu¢”).	[Ω–]		æ«			©Û		ßE	chheng2 	hak8# 	u15	u5# 	VA		O1#		COV	-O2#	“He has asked to study with me.” (“Sh£shu¢”)In certain colloquial time expressions the syllable representing the unit of time is unstressed, and again the preceding syllable has its juncture tone.	lak8=goeh etc.		‘June’ (and the names of other months) (Ilan).	chit8-goeh8=zit		‘one month’ (Ilan).	au7=zit		‘tomorrow’ (Ilan).	tso7=zit		‘the day before yesterday’ (Ilan).	zit8=si=a		‘daytime’ (Ilan).	sam1-put4-gÿ7=si=a	‘occasionally’ (Ilan)Hànbûn seems to lack examples of this kind entirely. Again, in Hànbûn only phrase-final aspect, topic-marking, and question particles are unstressed. There are other examples of loss of stress in the spoken language (for example, certain complements involving the numeral chit8 ‘one’), but as they have no corresponding forms in Hànbûn I omit them here.. Delimitation of syntactic units within the sentence. Subject and topicSandhi juncture also serves to delimit certain syntactic units within the sentence. The most important of these is the subject, the last syllable of which is tonally marked..	chip4-pun2-chheh4#	siuñ1		kui3#	(             S             )#	Adv		Adj#	 this-M-book 			 too 		expensive 	“This book is too expensive.”The junctures a the end of the subject and at the end of the whole sentence are the two most common in Taiwanese.Sometimes this juncture illustrates interesting syntactic facts. When asked one’s name, it is usual to reply as follows:.	sio2		señ3#			Lim5#	 small 	 surname 	 Lim  	“My humble name is Lim.” (Ilan)In Mandarin, we say the corresponding thing, xi§oxìng Lín, which seems to mean “I am insignificantly surnamed Lín”; the word xi§o ‘small’ seems to be an adverb. But the juncture after Taiwanese señ3 implies that the whole sentence has S-V rather than V-O structure. It appears the sentence really means “my insignificant surname [is] Lim.”Examples of juncture after the subject in Hànbûn are visible in sentences , , , above, and others below.An exception to the rule about juncture at the end of the is that pronouns as subject always have their context tone. For examples, see sentences  and , above, and others.The break between topic and comment functions similarly. As discussed by Chao (1968:69-72), topic-comment is not really a grammatical relationship at all, merely a way of making logical sense of the loose semantic relations between subject and predicate in, evidently, all form s of Chinese. It is fundamental to the expressive style of Hànbûn (e.g., ∂≥∑Q¶Áªn™·∑QÆe), although I have not found such clear examples in the spoken language. Here are two examples from the spoken language. They lack the delicious illogic of the best Mandarin and Hànbûn examples, although they are in fact topic-comment in structure because the main predicate of each sentence comprises a secondary subject and predicate:.	i1		cho3	khang1-khoe3#		kha1-chhiu2#	chiok4		kin2	=e	Pron	V		O						N					Adv		Adj	Particle	 s/he 	 do 	 work 					 hand and foot 	 very 		 fast 	 !  	(                 Topic 1              )		(                     Comment 1                    )#											Topic 2#			Comment 2#	= as for the way s/he works, hand and feet are fast!	“S/he gets things done quickly!” (Ilan).	chit4-phoe1-hoe3#				pun2-chiñ5#		ke7	Pron-Meas-N#					N					Adj#	 this 	 [meas] 	 wares 		 basic cost 		 low 	(            Topic 1           )#		(          Comment 1           )#										Topic 2#			Comment 2#	= as for these products, their cost is low	“These products cost the company little.” (Ilan)In reality the “topic” is no more than a subject, and it is to be expected that it should end in a juncture. Hànbûn exhibits the same situation:.	tsu15	kÿ1# !	pek4	siok4#	iu15	tsu2#!				pi2		ji5#	Ω—		©h			ßB		®˚			µS		§l					§Ò		®‡	(                  TOPIC             )#	(  COMMENT1  )#		(  COMMENT2  )#	= all aunts and uncles like child, like son	“[Toward] all your paternal aunts, [toward] your paternal uncles, be like a child, be like a son.” (Qi¡nzìwén)Of course this line does not mean that your aunts and uncles are like your children. Yet aunts and uncles are in fact the subject of a sentence whose predicate is “to be like a child or a son”.. Pivot-nounsA pivot noun is one that serves simultaneously as the object of a first verb and the subject of a second..	phai3		lang5#	khi3	khoañ3#	V			O#				S#			V1		V2#	 send 		 person 	 go 	 look  	“Send someone to see.” (Ilan)The pivot noun behaves simultaneously as object and subject, and displays the sandhi juncture typical of a subject. But, as with regular subject-pronouns, pivot pronouns appear in context form rather than juncture form .	chhoa7			goa2		kiañ5		=chit=pai	V					O						S			V			Complement	 accompany 		 me 		 walk 		 once  	“Take me for a little walk.” (Ilan)Hànbûn exhibits the same phenomenon:.	¶≥			™B			¶€			ª∑		§Ë			®”	iu2			peng5# !	tsu7		oan2	hong1#	lai5# !	VA 		O #				S #		COV 		(       O        )# 	VI#	“A friend comes from a far place.” (Analects I:1). Coordinate expressionsThere is normally a sandhi juncture between coordinate items and before any connective particles. [this section abridged ggg]. SubordinationSubordination in its various forms, principally modification of nouns and verbs, involves tonal marking in some but not all cases. The regular form of modification is that the modifier precedes the modified. . AdverbsAdverbs of time and place are tonally marked in both colloquial language and Hànbûn:.	siañ2-mih4	si5-kan#		beh4			khi3#	Mod			TW#			Aux			V#	 what 			 time 			 going to 		 go  	“When do you want to go?” (Ilan).	§È		™æ		®‰		©“		§`	zit8#	ti15	ki15	sÿ2	bu5#!	TW#	VA	(             O           )	“to know each day what one lacks” (Analects XIX:5)Adverbs of place in the spoken language include examples where a place-word (PW) ends in directional suffix, such as lai7, teng2, kha1, etc. In Hànbûn, when an adverb of place appears before the verb, it is ordinarily in juncture form:.	iu7#	thong1 !	kong2		loe7#	•k		≥q			ºs			§∫	PW#	VA		(         O         )#	“On the right [those in attendance] passed the “Within the Expanse” library.” (Qi¡nzìwén).	hu2#	lo15 !		chiong3	siong3#	©≤		√π			±N			¨€	PW#	VA		(         O         )#		In official mansions were arrayed generals and high ministers...However, place can also be indicated in Hànbûn after the verb. I do not have enough examples to generalize from, but it appears there may be a juncture after a verb-object, but not after a verb alone:.	iam15		thek8#		khiok4	hu7#	©a			¶v				¶±			™˙	VA		O#				(        PW       )#	“To build a dwelling at Q∞fù…” (Qi¡nzìwén)There is also a sandhi boundary at the end of the duration-phrase in a sentence of the form “have not V-ed in [length of time].” Examples: .	chit8-ni5#	 bo5	lai5	Duration		Neg	V	 one year 	 not 	 come  .	chin1-ku2#		bo5	khi3	Duration			Neg	V	 long time 		 not 	 go  	“I (etc.) haven’t gone in a long time.” (Ilan)Coverb phrases (consisting of a coverb and its object) function adverbially and are tonally marked, except when a pronoun is the object, in which case it is unmarked..	goa2	kah4 peng5-iu2#	tih4		kong2-oe7 [note ]	Pron	Cov-O#				Part		VO	 I 		  with friends 		 [progr] 	 talking  	“I’m talking to my friends.”.	i1		ka7 tai7-chi3# 	kong2		hoa7 thiañ1	[note ]	Pron	Cov-O#			V			Compl	 S/he 	 re. the matter 	 speaks 	 for me to hear  	“S/he tells me about the matter.”.	ka7 goan5-liau7# 	khng3#=jip=khi	[note ]	Cov-O#				V#-Compl	 re. materials 		 put inside 	“[Someone] puts the materials inside.”.	iong7 ki1-khi3# 	chiat4-seng2 jin5-lek8	Cov-O#				V				O	 by machine 			save 			 labor  	“to save labor by means of machinery”.	ti7 chhi7-tiuñ5# 	siau1-lÿ7#	chin1	ho2	Cov-O#				S#				Adj	 on the market 		 saleability 	 good  	“It sells well on the market.”.	hak8-hau7# 	li7 goan2-tau1#					bo5	hiah4	huiñ7	S#				Cov-O#							NEG	Adv	Adj	 school 		 distant from “our” home 	 not	 	 so 		 far  	“School is not so far from my house.”In Hànbûn, the same principle applies:.	ho7#	in1 !	ok4#	chek4#		hok4#		ian15 !	sian7#	kheng3#	∫◊		¶]		¥c		øn				∫÷			Ωt			µΩ			ºy	S#		COV	O#		VI#			S#			COV		O#			VI#	Misfortune accumulates because of evil; good fortune is given as a reward, following good deeds.” (Qi¡nzìwén)This is a good example, because the iambic meter of the Qi¡nzìwén would tend to promote the creation of non-syntactic junctures at the cæsuras after the second and sixth syllables (see Chiang and Yang 1998). The reader does prolong the cæsura syllables, but avoids imposing junctures there..	∏t§H				§ß			©“•H		¨∞		∏t	seng3-jin5# 	chi15		sÿ2 -i2#	ui15	seng3# 	N					Part		(O-Cov)	VA	O	“The reason a sage becomes a sage…” (“Sh£shu¢”)There is another example above in sentence . Coverb phrases often follow the verb in Hànbûn, especially with the coverbs hº5•G and u1 ©Û. Generally (but not always) there is no juncture boundary before the coverb. See sentences  and  for examples; there are more examples in the complete transcribed text of the “Sh£shu¢” in the Appendix (p. ).Most adverbs other than time and place, that is those describing manner, do not have a sandhi boundary. Ordinarily there is no juncture at the end of them. Here is a list of colloquial examples:.	hiam2+a	‘almost, very nearly’.	tu2-tu2	‘just now’ (also tu2-tu2+a) [note ].	pÿ7-pÿ7	‘continually, over and over’.	uiñ1+a	‘really, truly’ [note ].	kan2+a	‘apparently’.	kan1-na1	‘only’.	tiañ7	‘often’ (also tiañ7-tiañ7).	chiap8	‘hurriedly’.	sui5	‘immediately’.	liam5-piñ1	‘in just a moment’ [note ].	an2-choañ2	‘how?’.	eng2-koe3+a	‘long ago’.	put4-chi2+a	‘rather, quite’In other words, there are two classes of adverbs: adverbs in general are unmarked, but adverbs of time and place, as well as adverbial phrases consisting of a coverb and object, are marked. I feel that for Taiwanese adverbial expressions, the marked state is similar to the shì…de ¨O…™∫ pattern in Mandarin: the presence of the juncture emphasizes the conditions under which the action of the verb takes place.Excessive use of juncture can impart a highly formal sound to the spoken language. The speaker can emphasize an adverb by placing a juncture boundary after it. My impression is that this effect is more common with words of learned origin, which are often but not always calques of Mandarin forms. I have collected examples with the following forms.	chin1-chiañ3	‘really’.	choat8-tui3	‘absolutely’.	khak4-sit8	‘indeed, in fact’.	i2-keng1	‘already’.	ki5-sit8	‘actually, in truth’.	sui5-jian5	‘although’.	lim5-si5	‘on short notice, suddenly’In addition, there are some adverbs that my informants say never appear in context form:.	tai7-khai2 #	‘probably, approximately’.	long2-chong2 #	‘all in all, in total’.	m7-koh4#	‘however’.	bo5#	‘well in that case…’ (also na7-bo5) [note ].	an2-ne1#	‘in that/this way, in that case…’.	su7-sit8-siong7#	‘in truth’.	bok8-cheng5#	‘at present’.	kok4-lai7# 	‘domestically, within Taiwan’Marking an adjective by means of a sandhi juncture makes it sound more formal, and thus reinforces its learned quality. At times even a verb, especially one preceding a long object, may have sandhi juncture, which must be for reasons of emphasis (see sentence ). It happens that adverbs appearing within 4-character idioms generally end in a sandhi juncture: .	to1-to1#		chi2-kau3 	ADV			V	 much 		 provide instruction  	“I humbly request your guidance.” (polite) (Ilan)But why should an expression be made more formal in the first place? Most of these examples introduce the speaker’s opinion or a summation of the situation, which probably encourages a pause for reasons of discourse. A number of them also contain a directional suffix, making them susceptible to juncture for formal reasons alone.. Noun-modifiers and possessionModifiers of a noun (including possession) are marked by a juncture tone in their final syllable.Possession and modification are most often expressed using the particle e5..	lau7-su1#	e5			chhu3	N1				Part		N2	 teacher 		 [part] 	 book  	“the teacher’s book” (Ilan).	chit8-khÿ1#		e5			gin5-kak4+a	N1#				Part		N2#	 one dollar 		 [part] 	 coin  	“a one-dollar coin” (Ilan).In Hànbûn, although the particle is different (chi1), the same pattern appears. There are examples above in sentences , , and . Here is another:.	§µ			§ß			≤≥			§H	kim1# 	chi15		chiong3 	jin5# 	MOD#	PART		(         N        )#	“ordinary people today” (“Sh£shu¢”)The Taiwanese Hànbûn accent thus distinguishes between chi1 as a modification particle (preceded by juncture) and as an object (not preceded by juncture). Unfortunately, the third major use of chi1, as a verb, is ambiguous: it may or may not be preceded immediately by its subject, and so may or may not be preceded by juncture. That means it would be difficult to distinguish from its use as either pronoun or modification particle.Summary and Conclusion[omitted]Author’s contact information:David Prager BrannerSchool of Languages3215 Jimènez HallUniversity of MarylandCollege Park, MD  20942 USA	<branner@glue.umd.edu> or	<dpb23@columbia.edu>ReferencesSources of Dialect DataNotation of the form x\d (using the “Chao tone letters”) indicates that the juncture (“basic”) value of a tone is x\, and its context (“sandhi”) value is \d. 1.

Tone 4 is short if it ends in an oral stop, but may be long if it ends in h (representing glottal stop). An exception is that grammar particles (e.g., khah ‘more so’, kah ‘with’, etc.) tend to be short in any case. Ilan tends to pronounce tone 8 long in all cases, although the short value common in the rest of Taiwan is occasionally heard. I have indicated neutral tone (lack of explicit tonal category, usually accompanied by lack of stress) by the use of an equals sign (=) before the affected syllable:	hÿ7=goa		[hØ \d gua \ß ]I have also indicated the common morphological suffix á, which indicates a variety of functions (diminution or familiarity in nouns, ordinariness in adverbs, etc.), as +a. 		hiam2+a		[hiam \w ma\ß ]		sai2-hak8+a		[sai \w hag˘a N3\ ], etc. etc.Most of the Ilan sample sentences were inspired by material in Wu Hsiu-li (1994).2.
