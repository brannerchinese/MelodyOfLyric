        > For actually notating the music digitally, you'd probably enjoy Lilypond, a GPLed LaTeX-esque Scheme-based markup language for sheet music. Its default output is loads better than commercial software that costs hundreds of dollars, and if you're already approaching things from a programmer mindset it's not hard to learn. â€¦ Lilypond's default output is significantly better than the default output of Finale/Sibelius
