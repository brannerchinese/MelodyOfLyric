 1. Matt Ostrowski. Wrote to ask about transcription and notation services/tools, 20140903. He says everyone uses [Sibelius](http://www.sibelius.com/products/audioscore/ultimate.html) for notation now.
 
 1. Jeff Fowler and Kat Barone-Adesi recommend using Praat to detect pitches.

        > For actually notating the music digitally, you'd probably enjoy Lilypond, a GPLed LaTeX-esque Scheme-based markup language for sheet music. Its default output is loads better than commercial software that costs hundreds of dollars, and if you're already approaching things from a programmer mindset it's not hard to learn. â€¦ Lilypond's default output is significantly better than the default output of Finale/Sibelius
